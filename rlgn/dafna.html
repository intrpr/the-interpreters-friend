<CENTER><H2>Shut out from the Jewish world: Dafna's conversion to Judaism.</H2>

<P>A precedent was set this Monday (18 May 2003) when Dafna faced a Masorti (Conservative) Beit Din, in sign language. Dafna was born in the Muslim Arab world, to a deaf mother, with several deaf siblings. She is twenty years old and lives at a Boarding School in the north of the Israel.

<P>The first question that was asked of her by the Av Beit Din, Rabbi Reuven
Hammer, is why she wants to be a Jew. Dafna answered with great sincerity,
and told her story in sign language. Her social worker translated into
Hebrew for the three Rabbis on the Beit Din.

<P>As a deaf person she went to a Jewish boarding school, as there is no Arab
equivalent. She was fascinated by the story of Moses, (which she told at
great length to the Rabbis.) She fell in love with the Torah at age 12,
and has been thirsty to learn Judaism ever since.

<P>I met her earlier in the school year, when we offered a bar/bat mitzvah
program at her school, and did not limit it by age. At the first lesson,
Dafna participated actively and shook with excitement. "Finally I am
learning Judaism intensively!"  Apparently she brought a name of one Rabbi
after another to her social worker, but none agreed to teach her for
conversion, some refused because she is deaf, some because she is Arab.
She was rejected and given a negative answer some twenty times.

<P>I asked Rabbi Andy Sacks if the Masorti Movement would agree to convert
her,and was told that it was possible. So I offered to teach her, and have
worked with her intensely for most of the year. She was a delight to
teach, because everything touched her and excited her. She was overwhelmed the
first time she went into a synagogue to learn the synagogue symbols.

<P>Every lesson we lit Shabbat candles together, seeing the light, in fact
all our lessons emphasized Dafna's four strongest senses. But communication
was never an obstacle. I taught her the blessings and prayers in sign
language, but we discussed theology with the help of her social worker's
interpretation. Dafna's love of Judaism was an inspiration in our lessons,
and we discussed relationships sanctioned by Judaism. How does one love?
With all one's heart, with all one's soul, with all one's might, listening
means opening up one's life to Elohim and to the needs of other people.
Hear O Israel.

<P>The three Rabbis who sat on the Beit Din had never seen the blessings,
torah stories and a description of the holidays with the visual clarity which
sign language brings. Rabbi Joel Berman said, "pleasant surprises filled the
entire encounter.  She was eager to share even more information than we
asked for. For example, we asked about other candles that are lit, and she
not only told about Havdalah but about the three stars in the sky." Rabbi
Reuven Hammer, who has a Doctorate in Special Education said, "I was very
taken with her because she was so sincere and anxious to express herself.
You could see it in her hands and in her eyes. It was more than beautiful.
" Rabbi Andy Sacks said, " it was incredible, I am aware how shut out the
Deaf community is from the Jewish world, they are almost invisible.  
Dafna was exceptionally brave in wanting to learn about Judaism, in facing the
Beit Din, in going to the mikvah, in signing her answers to hearing
people.

<P>When Dafna emerged from behind the curtain of the Mikvah, her face was
shining. She had a radiant presence and smile."

<P>I was very privileged to be the Mikvah attendant.  We were alone behind
the curtain, at a stunning outdoor mikvah in a nature setting. The Rabbis
could hear our brachot through the curtain, Dafna vocalizes when she signs. I
held up a towel to guard Dafna's privacy. She immersed herself in the freezing
cold pool of spring water. Her hands shook with the cold as we signed and
vocalized the bracha for immersing in a mikveh. She dunked a second time,
"kosher" I pronounced it, and we blessed the Shecheyanu prayer. She dunked 
a third time, and I held the towel out to her, and my hand to help her up
the ladder steps. After she dressed we had a special hug. How does one love?
With all one's heart, with all one's soul, with all one's might, listening
means opening up one's life to Elohim and to the needs of other people.
Hear O Israel. Dafna, a young Jewish woman, has proven that.

<P>Dafna's bat mitzvah will take place very soon, in sign language with a few
other Jewish young people.
