<DT><B>CCW</B><DD>counterclockwise (as seen from above or from DS) as in WE. Note that this is for the signer who is right-handed. CCW for the left-handed will become CW and vice versa. I devised a handedness-neutral notation, but it is too complicated and therefore confusing. 

<DT><B>ctr</B><DD>center

<DT><B>CW</B><DD>clockwise (as seen from above or from DS) as in THEREABOUTS/APPROXIMATELY. Note that this is for the signer who is right-handed. CW for the left-handed will become CCW and vice versa. I devised a handedness-neutral notation, but it is too complicated and therefore confusing.

<DT><B>PO</B><DD>palm orientation

<DT><B>POSS.</B><DD>possessive, that is, [B], PO towards whatever is being referenced

<DT><B>pronate</B><DD>hand is twisted so that  PO is down or away from the signer, as in lying prone before the emperor

<DT><B>RECT-CL</B><DD>(2h)L, PO away, FO up, touch like FTs and separate while closing to (2h)bO to trace out a rectangle in air

<DT><B>1x, 2x, 3x</B><DD>once, twice, three times (sometimes notated x1, x2, x3); used instead of "+" when sign is usually produced twice, but now once (or vice versa), or in descriptions that do not use the gloss, so there is no sign to add "+" to

<P><B>Glossing techniques (Cokely-Baker, Bar-Tzur)</B>
<OL>
<LI>Each sign is represented by an English word or phrase in all capital letters and may be in bold: ME SPEAK HEBREW CAN.
<LI>Initialized signs are indicated by the substituted handshape, a dash, and the base sign: A-CALCULATE for "algebra".
<LI>Fingerspelled vocabulary is indicated by bolded upper case letters separated by dashes: P-H-A-S-E for "phase".  A single fingerspelled letter is enclosed in quotes: "E".
<LI>Signs that are generated by repetition of base signs, are indicated with a plus sign. HELP++ for "helpful".
<LI>Signs that are blends of other signs can be represented by a tilda (~) TRUE~WORK for "actually".
<LI>If a sign uses parts of the body as a direct object, the sign is followed by an at symbol (@) and the body part described in lowercase letters: HURT@(left hip) for "my left hip hurts".
<LI>If spatialization and directionality are used, "lf"," rt", "ctr" can be used for "left", "right", and "center".
</OL>

<P><B>More detailed description (Bar-Tzur)</B>
<OL>
<LI>For signs that can not be related to signs that have a standard gloss, a more complex system is used.  
<LI>If the sign is two-handed and the handshapes are the same, (2h) is used and then the handshape is enclosed in square brackets.  (2h)[F] would be the handshapes for the sign JUDGE.
<LI>If two-handed, but the handshapes are different, DH (dominant hand) is used, indicating the handshape, later listing NDH (non-dominant hand).  NDH may be omitted since the other handshape must now be on the NDH.  For POPULAR, the handshapes would be NDH [1] and DH [5].    
<LI>Palm orientations are specified: PO up, PO down, PO > NDS (non-dominant side), PO > DS (dominant side), PO towards (towards signer), PO away (away from signer), POs >&lt; (palms face each other).  Here are the POs for some more signs: STOP (NDPO up, DPO > DS), WARN (both hands PO down), MEET (POs >&lt;), EMERGENCY (PO away), MIRROR (PO > signer).   
<LI>FO specifies fingertip orientation, similarly to PO.  Remember FO is defined in linguistics as the direction the fingertips would point if they were extended, not based on a closed HS, so that EQUAL  would be FOs up, not FOs >&lt;.  
<LI>If handshapes are used as classifiers, information showing how the classifier moves is described in single quotes, such as 1-CL'person walk up to me suddenly'.
<LI>If the NDH stays in place from a previous sign while the DH continues a new sign, a dashed arrow can show the duration of the hold.
<LI>Examples of a full glossing would be:  (1) RACE/COMPETE - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs away, alt. move FO from up to away with hands held close together.  (2) AWFUL - DH [8], PO > NDS, FO up, is held over shoulder and moves away while flicking middle finger to become a [5].  (3) WIND - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, sway antisymmetrically from side to side while pronating and supinating the palms.
