<P>Thanks for visiting my site!  I have finally gotten around to reading two years' worth of results sent to me by FreeFind. It has helped me see how people search for items and I realize that it would be worthwhile for me to offer some suggestions so that you can get the full benefit of such a search.

<P>(1) Before you start your search, try reading the <A HREF="http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/index.html">home page</A> table of contents to see if your search topic is under any of the pages listed.

<P>(2) Don't be too specific. If you search for <I>interpreting for history</I>, you will get every page that contains the word "interpreting" or "for" or "history".  That's too much information. Better to just search for <I>history</I>, since almost everything in my site is about interpreting.

<P>(3) Don't use quotes unless you only want to find that exact phrase. If you search for <I>"sign for holocaust"</I> you will not find anything that just contains <I>holocaust</I>, only places where that exact three-word phrase occurs. It will not help you find the sign for holocaust. If you are searching for the sign for something, please see <A HREF="tech/vocab/a.html">Signs for technical/specialized vocabulary</A>. If you want signs for a specific topic but don't know what I might have, see <A HREF="tech/vocab/vl/toc.html">Vocabulary lists by topic</A>. Many of the signs that were in this site previously have been recorded in my CD entitled <A HREF="http://www.signs-of-development.org/website/PDS1510d.htm">Technical & specialized vocabulary ASL dictionary.</A> If you search for any of the signs that are now in this CD, you will be referred to <A HREF="http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/tech/dict-list.html">Table of contents for Technical & specialized vocabulary ASL dictionary.</A> This means you would have to purchase the 2-CD set to see that sign.   

<P>(4) I have seen multiple attempts on the same day to find something that was misspelled, so if you can't find something, check your spelling.

<P>(5) If you are looking for an image, an excellent site to use is <A HREF="http://www.altavista.com/image/default">Alta Vista - Image search.</A>

<P>(6) For an explanation of my glossing system, see <a href="http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/tech/glws.html">Explanation of the glossing system.</a>

<P>(7) If you are looking for an ASL translation of a song, see <A HREF="http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/songs/toc.html">Songs and ritual texts: Table of contents.</A>
