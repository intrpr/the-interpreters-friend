<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A>

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>5-LOOK - [5], PO > signer, FO up, hand moves in a vertical circle around the face.
 
<P>SHINE-DOWN-GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. (Personally, I like to flutter the fingers.) For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A>

<P>INSIDE-SELF - Hold the FT of [C] against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>PEACE"full sign" - (2h)[Bb], cross in front of mouth and descend diagonally (like QUIET), then hands clasp as in MARRY and then clasp again with hands reversed in dominance.

<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B> The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.
