<P>When the infant is brought in the entire assemblage greets him:

<P>(2h)#ALL<a href="brit-milah.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> SAY: WELCOME BABY. NOW EIGHTH D-A-Y, HIMSELF READY PUT-UP-WITH<a href="brit-milah.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> CIRCUMCISE<a href="brit-milah.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<P>The mohel (in some congregations, all those present) then recites:

<P>MOHEL<a href="brit-milah.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> (CIRCUMCISE AGENT) SAY: CHAIR INDEX-'Elijah's chair'<a href="brit-milah.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> FOR-FOR?

<P>All present respond:

<P>(2h)#ALL SAY: WE LOOK-FORWARD YOUR HOLY TEMPLE SET-UP WHERE? JERUSALEM<a href="brit-milah.html#12"><sup>12</sup></a>.

<P>When the mohel is ready to perform the circumcision, the baby's father says:

<P>FATHER SAY: KNOW-THAT<a href="brit-milah.html#13"><sup>13</sup></a> <U>ME</U> PREPARED<a href="brit-milah.html#14"><sup>14</sup></a>, READY OBEY POSITIVE COMMANDMENT <U>HE</U> HIMSELF MAKE WORLD COMMAND ME. WHAT? CIRCUMCISE MY SON.

<P>In some congregations at this point the father verbally appoints the mohel as his agent to perform circumcision on his son. 

<P>The mohel takes the infant and proclaims joyously:

<P>MOHEL SAY: WE PRAISE GOD HIMSELF HOLY. <U>HE</U> TELL-lf ABRAHAM<a href="brit-milah.html#15"><sup>15</sup></a> OUR FOREFATHER<a href="brit-milah.html#16"><sup>16</sup></a>, (role play God to Abraham) <U>ME</U> WATCH-lf"over time" CAREFUL. (end role play) <U>ME</U> PREPARED, READY OBEY POSITIVE COMMANDMENT, HIMSELF-G-d MAKE WORLD COMMAND US, IF BOY OLD EIGHT D-A-Y, CIRCUMCISE MUST.

<P>The baby is placed in the sandak's knees. Just before performing the circumcision, the mohel recites:

<P>MOHEL SAY: LORD, OUR GOD, <U>YOU</U> CONTROL WORLD IDEA~LIKE KING, WE PRAISE. WHY? <U>YOU</U> MAKE US HOLY THROUGH COMMANDMENT, AND COMMAND US CIRCUMCISE OUR CHILDREN. (2h)#ALL SAY: AMEN.

<P>As the mohel performs the circumcision, the father (or if the father is not present, the sandak) recites:

<P>FATHER SAY: LORD, OUR GOD, <U>YOU</U> CONTROL WORLD IDEA~LIKE KING, WE PRAISE. WHY? <U>YOU</U> MAKE US HOLY THROUGH COMMANDMENT, AND COMMAND US HELP SON ENTER COVENANT<a href="brit-milah.html#17"><sup>17</sup></a> LIKE ABRAHAM OUR FOREFATHER.

<P>(2h)#ALL SAY: AMEN. BABY RECENTLY ENTER COVENANT. NOW WE PRAY <U>HE</U>-baby ALSO WORTH (1) LEARN TORAH, (2) MARRY, (3) HELP"each" PEOPLE.

<P>When the circumcision is complete, the baby is given to one of the prominent guests to hold, while the following prayers (including the giving of the name) are recited. The honor of reciting them may be given to one person, or they may be divided between two people. If so, the first person recites the two blessings and the second person recites the prayer during which the baby is given his name.

<P>LORD, OUR GOD, <U>YOU</U> CONTROL WORLD IDEA~LIKE KING, WE PRAISE. WHY? WHY? <U>YOU</U> MAKE GRAPES.
