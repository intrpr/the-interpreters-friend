<P>The Sounding of the Shofar

<P>DURING SEVENTH MONTH, FIRST DAY, PEOPLE ASSEMBLE FOR HOLY REASON SHOULD. ANY CREATIVE WORK STOP MUST. THAT DAY SHOFAR SOUND-shofar MUST.

<P>[Note: The way I represent the sounding of the shofar is to first fingerspell the type of shofar blast that is called out by the sh'lach tzibbur, then sign SHOFAR, that is the two S hands are held at the mouth with the dominant hand in front of the nondominant hand, then the dominant hand moves away and opens to show the twist of the shofar and how it flares open. The hands are held in place, and for the tekiah, I bow my head at the beginning of the blast and raise it again as the blast ends. For shevarim, which is three shorter blasts, I raise and lower my head with the same duration and repetition of the blasts. For teruah, approximately 10 very rapid blasts, I lower my head and vibrate the imaginary shofar by moving the hands back and forth in small tremulous movements, again always with the same duration and  number of repetitions that I am hearing at the moment, and then raise my head when
all of the blasts are through. Below is the order of the soundings:]
