<P><A NAME="s-s"><H3>Survival signs (General and Shabbat)</H3><FONT SIZE="+1">
	
<P>In this first section, I provide you with about 130 survival signs; these constitute the minimum group of signs you would need to interpret a Shabbat (Sabbath) service with possible mention of future holidays. This is the most frequently interpreted event, especially when there is a Bar/Bat Mitzvah. They are glossed with a symbolic system that is explained at the end of this handout.  For definitions of the terms, see <A HREF="http://www.jewfaq.org/glossary.htm">Judaism 101 - Glossary of Jewish Terminology</A> or use a web browser to search for "Jewish glossary". This works better than "Jewish dictionary" as a search phrase, which tends to lead you to either Yiddish-English or Hebrew-English dictionaries.

<P><DT>mitzvah, commandment<DD>(2h)[M], POs away, FOs up, move antisymmetrically (not like mirror images) from side to side.
