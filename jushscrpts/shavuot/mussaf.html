<LI><a name="64">FAVOR - middle finger of [open 8] taps chin.

<LI><a name="65">If the Kohanim ascend to pronounce the blessing, continue here - An explanation of Birkat Kohanim (the Blessing of the Priests) is necessary here. During the Mussaf service on Festivals, those members of the congregation who would serve as priests (kohanim) if the Temple in Jerusalem were still extant leave the sanctuary with those members who would serve as Levites (assistant priests).  At this point in the service, the kohanim ascend the platform in the front of the synagogue. They cover their head with their prayer shawls, utter a blessing on the blessing (smile), and the congregation says "Amen!" The prayer leader then prompts the kohanim by saying the first word of the blessing which the kohanim repeat and so on for each word.  After the third word, the eighth word and the final word is said by the prayer leader, the kohanim sing a slow dirge and then repeat the leader's word. This is why I have added the phrase "(KOHEN GROUP SING WITHOUT WORD.)" It is not something that is said aloud by anyone, but is meant to explain to the Deaf congregants why the kohanim are making sounds but you are not interpreting them. It is sometimes necessary to use more than one sign per word for the sentence to make sense. For the same reason, I have followed ASL syntax not Hebrew syntax.  I feel it is confusing to sign each "word" twice: once when the Prayer Leader prompts the kohanim, and once when the kohanim say the word.  Wait for the kohanim to say the word (don't interpret the Leader) because they are blessing the congregation, not the Leader. I have put the Hebrew word in parentheses just before the glossing to help the interpret keep his/her place.
