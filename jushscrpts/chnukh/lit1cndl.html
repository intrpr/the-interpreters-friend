<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Light one candle for the Maccabee children
<BR>With thanks that their light didn't die.
<BR>Light one candle for the pain they endured,
<BR>When their right to exist was denied.
<BR>Light one candle for the terrible sacrifice,
<BR>Justice and freedom demand.
<BR>But light one candle for the wisdom to know
<BR>When the peacemaker's time is at hand.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Don't let the light go out!
<BR>It's lasted for so many years!
<BR>Don't let the light go out!
<BR>Let it shine through our love and our tears.

<P>2. Light one candle for the strength that we need
<BR>To never become our own foe,
<BR>And light one candle for those who are suffering
<BR>Pain we learned so long ago.
<BR>Light one candle for all we believe in
<BR>That anger not tear us apart,
<BR>And light one candle to find us together
<BR>With peace as the song in our hearts. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. What is the memory that's valued so highly
<BR>That we keep it alive in that flame?
<BR>What's the commitment to those who have died
<BR>That we cry out they've not died in vain?
<BR>We have come this far always believing
<BR>That justice would somehow prevail.
<BR>This is the burden; this is the promise;
<BR>This is why we will not fail! <B>Refrain</B>

<P>||: (3x) Don't let the light go out! :||
