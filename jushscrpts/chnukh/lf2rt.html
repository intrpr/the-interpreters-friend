<P><B>Refrain:</B> Tonight we light
<BR>the Hanukkah candles from left to right

<P>Our favorite time of year is here:
<BR>the Festival of Lights.
<BR>We celebrate our victory.
<BR>We celebrate our rights.

<P>First you take a single candle,
<BR>and you start it with a spark,
<BR>then you pass it all around the world.
<BR>Bring light unto the dark. <B>Refrain</B> (Twice)

<P>From the left to the right,
<BR>see the candles burning bright.
<BR>From the east to the west,
<BR>use just one to light the rest.

<BR>people gather on this day,
<BR>A miracle has happened,
<BR>so we light a candle and say. <B>Refrain</B> (4 times)
