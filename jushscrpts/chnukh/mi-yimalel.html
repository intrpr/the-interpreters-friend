<P>Mi yi-ma-lel g'vu-rot yis-ra-el, otan mi yimneh? 
<BR>Hen be-chol dor ya-kum ha-gi-bor go-el ha-am.

<P>Shma! Ba-ya-mim ha-hem, baz-man ha-zeh,
<BR>mac-ca-bee mo-shi-a uf-o-deh -- 
<BR>Uv-ya-mei-nu kol am yis-ra-el
<BR>yit-ach-ed, ya-kum ve-yi-ga-el

<P>Who can retell the things that befell us? Who can count them? 
<BR>In every age a hero or sage came to our aid.

<P>Hark! In days of old in Israel's ancient land,
<BR>Brave Maccabeus led the fearless band.
<BR>And now all Israel must as one arise; 
<BR>Redeem itself through deed and sacrifice.
