<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I have a little dreidel, I made it out of clay,
<BR>and when it's dry and ready, oh dreidel I shall play.
<BR>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay,
<BR>and when it's dry and ready, oh dreidel I shall play.

<P>It has a lovely body, with legs so short and thin,
<BR>and when it gets all tired, it drops and then I win.
<BR>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with legs so short and thin,
<BR>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, it drops and then I win.

<P>My dreidel's always playful; it loves to laugh and spin; a happy game of <BR>dreidel, come play, now let's begin.
<BR>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, it loves to laugh and spin,
<BR>Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, come play, now let's begin.

<P>One person spins the dreidel
<BR>And when the spinning's through
<BR>The dreidel drops with one side up
<BR>And tells you what to do.

<P>Nun means you get nothing
<BR>Gimmel means you win
<BR>Hay means you get half the pot
<BR>And Shin you put one in.
