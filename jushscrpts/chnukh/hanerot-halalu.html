<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> LAMP - [8] flicks middle finger against chin.

<P>KOHEN - The hands are held with thumbs touching, POs face away from signer, and the fingers are held together but split 	between the middle and ring fingers, like Mr. Spock on Star Trek (Leonard Nemoy is a cohen and got the gesture from this one which is used to bless the people during holidays).

<P>OPPRESSION-OFF - DH [B] lifts upwards and off from contacting [S], PO > DS while mouthing "off".

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Hanerot halalu anachnu madlikin 
<BR>Al hanissim ve'al haniflaot 
<BR>Al hatshu-ot ve'al hamilchamot 
<BR>She-asita la'avoteynu 
<BR>Bayamim hahem, bazman hazeh
<BR>Al yedey kohanecha hakdoshim.

<P>Vechol shmonat yemey Chanukah
<BR>Hanerot halalu kodesh hem, 
<BR>Ve-ein lanu reshut lehishtamesh bahem 
<BR>Ela lirotam bilvad
<BR>Kedai lehodot leshimcha
<BR>Al nissecha veal nifleotecha ve-al yeshuotecha. 

<P>We light these lights
<BR>For the miracles and the wonders,
<BR>For the redemption and the battles
<BR>That you made for our forefathers
<BR>In those days at this season,
<BR>Through your holy priests.

<P>During all eight days of Chanukah
<BR>These lights are sacred 
<BR>And we are not permitted to make 
<BR>Ordinary use of them, 
<BR>But only to look at them; 
<BR>In order to express thanks 
<BR>And praise to Your great Name 
<BR>For your miracles, Your wonders 
<BR>And your salvations.
