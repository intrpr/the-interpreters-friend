<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> TURN - (2h)[1], POs > signer, circle around each other.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>CONTACT - (2h)[open 8] touch middle fingers.

<P>DIVERSE - (2h)[5], POs down, FTs overlap. Hands separate with wg. 

<P>MAGNIFYING - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, separate in upward arcs.

<P>BIG-QUESTION - like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that is a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Turning turning spirits yearning
<BR>Reaching for the night.
<BR>Colors going, 
<BR>shadows growing,
<BR>Darkening the night.
<BR>Ancient story told, 
<BR>renewed with the cold.
<BR>Mystery of light, 
<BR>burnt into the night.
