<P>2.
 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to my help.

<P>3.
Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me; say unto my soul: 'I am Thy salvation.'

<P>4.
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt.

<P>5.
Let them be as chaff before the wind, the angel of HaShem thrusting them.

<P>6.
Let their way be dark and slippery, the angel of HaShem pursuing them.

<P>7.
For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net, without cause have they digged for my soul.

<P>8.
Let destruction come upon him unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself; with destruction let him fall therein.

<P>9.
And my soul shall be JUMP-FOR-JOY in HaShem; it shall rejoice in His salvation.

<P>10.
All my bones shall say: 'HaShem, who is like unto Thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?'

<P>11.
 Unrighteous witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not.

<P>12.
 They repay me evil for good; bereavement is come to my soul.

<P>13.
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting; and my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.

<P>14.
I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother; I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.

<P>15.
But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together; the abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; they tear me, and cease not;

<P>16.
With the profanest mockeries of backbiting they gnash at me with their teeth.

<P>17.
L-rd, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, mine only one from the lions.

<P>18.
I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a numerous people.

<P>19.
Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
20
For they speak not peace; but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.

<P>21.
 Yea, they open their mouth wide against me; they say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.'

<P>22.
 Thou hast seen, O HaShem; keep not silence; O L-rd, be not far from me.

<P>23.
Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my G-d and my L-rd.

<P>24.
Judge me, O HaShem my G-d, according to Thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

<P>25.
Let them not say in their heart: 'Aha, we have our desire'; let them not say: 'We have swallowed him up.'

<P>26.
Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt; let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me.

<P>27.
Let them shout for JUMP-FOR-JOY, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness; yea, let them say continually: 'Magnified be HaShem, who delighteth in the peace of His servant.'

<P>28.
And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, and of Thy praise all the day.-->

 Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks- there is no fear of G-d before his eyes.

<P>3.
For it flattereth him in his eyes, until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.

<P>4.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wise, to do good.

<P>5.
He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

<P>6.
Thy lovingkindness, O HaShem, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.

<P>7.
Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast Thou preservest, O HaShem.

<P>8.
How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O G-d! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.

<P>9.
They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.

<P>10.
For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light.

<P>11.
 O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

 Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

<P>2.
 For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade as the green herb.

<P>3.
Trust in HaShem, and do good; dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.

<P>4.
So shalt thou delight thyself in HaShem; and He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.

<P>5.
Commit thy way unto HaShem; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.

<P>6.
And He will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy right as the noonday.

<P>7.
Resign thyself unto HaShem, and wait patiently for Him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

<P>8.
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.

<P>9.
For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for HaShem, they shall inherit the land.

<P>10.
And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more; yea, thou shalt look well at his place, and he is not.

<P>11.
 But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<P>12.
 The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth at him with his teeth.

<P>13.
The L-rd doth laugh at him; for He seeth that his day is coming.

<P>14.
The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as are upright in the way;

<P>15.
Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

<P>16.
Better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked.

<P>17.
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but HaShem upholdeth the righteous.

<P>18.
HaShem knoweth the days of them that are wholehearted; and their inheritance shall be for ever.

<P>19.
They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<P>20.
For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of HaShem shall be as the fat of lambs-they shall pass away in smoke, they shall pass away.

<P>21.
 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not; but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.

<P>22.
 For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the land; and they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off.

<P>23.
It is of HaShem that a man's goings are established; and He delighted in his way.

<P>24.
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for HaShem upholdeth his hand.

<P>25.
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

<P>26.
All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

<P>27.
Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

<P>28.
For HaShem loveth justice, and forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

<P>29.
The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

<P>30.
The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh justice.

<P>31.
 The TORAHTORAH<a href="Psalms.html#TORAH">*</a> of his G-d is in his heart; none of his steps slide.

<P>32.
 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

<P>33.
HaShem will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged.

<P>34.
Wait for HaShem, and keep His way, and He will exalt thee to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

<P>35.
I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a leafy tree in its native soil.

<P>36.
But one passed by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

<P>37.
Mark the man of integrity, and behold the upright; for there is a future for the man of peace.

<P>38.
But transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.

<P>39.
But the salvation of the righteous is of HaShem; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.

And HaShem helpeth them, and delivereth them; He delivereth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in Him.-->

 O HaShem, rebuke me not in Thine anger; neither chasten me in Thy wrath.

<P>3.
For Thine arrows are gone deep into me, and Thy hand is come down upon me.

<P>4.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.

<P>5.
For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

<P>6.
My wounds are noisome, they fester, because of my foolishness.

<P>7.
I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day.

<P>8.
For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh.

<P>9.
I am benumbed and sore crushed; I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart.

<P>10.
L-rd, all my desire is before Thee; and my sighing is not hid from Thee.

<P>11.
<U>ME</U> HEART-THROB, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

<P>12.
 My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

<P>13.
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices, and utter deceits all the day.

<P>14.
But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

<P>15.
Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no arguments.

<P>16.
For in Thee, O HaShem, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O L-rd my G-d.

<P>17.
For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.'

<P>18.
For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me.

<P>19.
For I do declare mine iniquity; I am full of care because of my sin.

<P>20.
But mine enemies are strong in health; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

<P>21.
 They also that repay evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.

<P>22.
 Forsake me not, O HaShem; O my G-d, be not far from me.

 I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.'

<P>3.
I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; and my pain was held in check.

<P>4.
My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing, the fire kindled; then spoke I with my tongue:

<P>5.
'HaShem, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am.

<P>6.
Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; and mine age is as nothing before Thee; surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah

<P>7.
Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; surely for vanity they are in turmoil; he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.

<P>8.
And now, L-rd, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.

<P>9.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the base.

<P>10.
I am dumb, I open not my mouth; because Thou hast done it.

<P>11.
 Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.

<P>12.
 With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; surely every man is vanity. Selah

<P>13.
Hear my prayer, O HaShem, and give ear unto my cry; keep not silence at my tears; for I am a stranger with Thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

Look away from me, that I may take comfort, before I go hence, and be no more.'-->

<P>2.
 O G-d, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; a work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.

<P>3.
Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.

<P>4.
For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favourable unto them.

<P>5.
Thou art my King, O G-d; command the salvation of Jacob.

<P>6.
Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.

<P>7.
For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me.

<P>8.
But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.

In G-d have we gloried all the day, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Selah

<P>10.
Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; and goest not forth with our hosts.

<P>11.
 Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; and they that hate us spoil at their will.

<P>12.
 Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; and hast scattered us among the nations.

<P>13.
Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, and hast not set their prices high.

<P>14.
Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.

<P>15.
Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

<P>16.
All the day is my confusion before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,

<P>17.
For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the revengeful.

<P>18.
All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we been false to Thy covenant.

<P>19.
Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Thy path;

<P>20.
Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

<P>21.
 If we had forgotten the name of our G-d, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;

<P>22.
 Would not G-d search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<P>23.
Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

<P>24.
Awake, why sleepest Thou, O L-rd? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.

<P>25.
Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

<P>26.
For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

<P>27.
Arise for our help, and redeem us for Thy mercy's sake.-->

G-d in her palaces hath made Himself known for a stronghold.

For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they came onward together.

They saw, straightway they were amazed; they were affrighted, they hasted away.

Trembling took hold of them there, pangs, as of a woman in travail.

Both low and high, rich and poor together.

My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.

Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,

No man can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to G-d a ransom for him-

For too costly is the redemption of their soul, and must be let alone for ever-

That he should still live alway, that he should not see the pit.

<P>11.
 For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others.

<P>12.
 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.

But man abideth not in honour; he is like the beasts that perish.

This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them approve their sayings. Selah

Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; death shall be their shepherd; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, that there be no habitation for it.

Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, when the wealth of his house is increased;

For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his wealth shall not descend after him.

<P>2.
 Give ear, O G-d, to my prayer; and hide not Thyself from my supplication.

<P>3.
Attend unto me, and hear me; I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan;

<P>4.
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast mischief upon me, and in anger they persecute me.

<P>5.
My heart doth writhe within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

<P>6.
Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

<P>7.
And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove! then would I fly away, and be at rest.

<P>8.
Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah

<P>9.
I would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.'

<P>10.
Destroy, O L-rd, and divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<P>11.
 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.

<P>12.
 Wickedness is in the midst thereof; oppression and guile depart not from her broad place.

<P>13.
For it was not an enemy that taunted me, then I could have borne it; neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me, then I would have hid myself from him.

<P>14.
But it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend;

<P>15.
We took sweet counsel together, in the house of G-d we walked with the throng.

<P>16.
May He incite death against them, let them go down alive into the nether-world; for evil is in their dwelling, and within them.

<P>17.
As for me, I will call upon G-d; and HaShem shall save me.

<P>18.
Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; and He hath heard my voice.

<P>19.
He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; for they were many that strove with me.

<P>20.
G-d shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah, such as have no changes, and fear not G-d.
<P>21.
 He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant.

<P>22.
 Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth, but his heart was war; his words were softer than oil, yet were they keen-edged swords.

<P>23.
Cast thy burden upon HaShem, and He will sustain thee; He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.

<P>24.
But Thou, O G-d, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit; men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days; but as for me, I will trust in Thee.-->

In the day that I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.

<P>5.
In G-d--I will praise His word--in G-d do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me?

<P>6.
All the day they trouble mine affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil.

<P>7.
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps; according as they have waited for my soul.

<P>8.
Because of iniquity cast them out; in anger bring down the peoples, O G-d.

<P>9.
Thou has counted my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; are they not in Thy book?

 Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?

Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.

<P>4.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; the speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.

<P>5.
Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;

<P>6.
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, or of the most cunning binder of spells.

<P>7.
Break their teeth, O G-d, in their mouth; break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O HaShem.

<P>8.
Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.

Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.

Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: 'For who doth hear?'

But Thou, O HaShem, shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt have all the nations in derision.

For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.

<!--<P><A NAME="P73"><B>PSALM 73</B>

<P>1.
 A Psalm of Asaph. Surely G-d is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.
<P>2.
 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

<P>3.
For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

<P>4.
For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.

<P>5.
In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.

<P>6.
Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.

<P>7.
Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.

<P>8.
They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.

<P>9.
They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.

<P>10.
Therefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them.

<P>11.
 And they say: 'How doth G-d know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'

<P>12.
 Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches.

<P>13.
Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;

<P>14.
For all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning.


<P>15.
If I had said: 'I will speak thus', behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.

<P>16.
And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes;

<P>17.
Until I entered into the sanctuary of G-d, and considered their end.

<P>18.
Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.

<P>19.
How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.

<P>20.
As a dream when one awaketh, so, O L-rd, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.

<P>21.
 For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins.

<P>22.
 But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.

<P>23.
Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.

<P>24.
Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory.

<P>25.
Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.

<P>26.
My flesh and my heart faileth; but G-d is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.

<P>27.
For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.

<P>28.
But as for me, the nearness of G-d is my good; I have made the L-rd GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works.-->

<!--<P><A NAME="P74"><B>PSALM 74</B>

<P>1.
 Maschil of Asaph. Why, O G-d, hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture?

<P>2.
 Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old, which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance; and mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.

<P>3.
Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins, even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.

<P>4.
Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place; they have set up their own signs for signs.

<P>5.
It seemed as when men wield upwards axes in a thicket of trees.

<P>6.
And now all the carved work thereof together they strike down with hatchet and hammers.

<P>7.
They have set Thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name even to the ground.

<P>8.
They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether'; they have burned up all the meeting-places of G-d in the land.

<P>9.
We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

<P>10.
How long, O G-d, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?

<P>11.
 Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand? Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.

<P>12.
 Yet G-d is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

<P>13.
Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength; Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

<P>14.
Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.

<P>15.
Thou didst cleave fountain and brook; Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.

<P>16.
Thine is the day, Thine also the night; Thou hast established luminary and sun.

<P>17.
Thou hast set all the BORDER of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.

<P>18.
Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached HaShem, and how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.

<P>19.
O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast; forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.

<P>20.
Look upon the covenant; for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.

<P>21.
 O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion; let the poor and needy praise Thy name.

<P>22.
 Arise, O G-d, plead Thine own cause; remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.

<P>23.
Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, the tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually.-->

<P>2.
 We give thanks unto Thee, O G-d, we give thanks, and Thy name is near; men tell of Thy wondrous works.

<P>3.
'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity.

<P>4.
When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.' Selah

<P>5.
I say unto the arrogant: 'Deal not arrogantly'; and to the wicked: 'Lift not up the horn.'

<P>6.
Lift not up your horn on high; speak not insolence with a haughty neck.

<P>7.
For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up.

<P>8.
For G-d is judge; He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.

<P>9.
For in the hand of HaShem there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture, and He poureth out of the same; surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.

<P>10.
But as for me, I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the G-d of Jacob.

<P>11.
 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.-->

<P>2.
 In Judah is G-d known; His name is great in Israel.

<P>3.
In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion.

<P>4.
There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah

<P>5.
Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey.

<P>6.
The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.

<P>7.
At Thy rebuke, O G-d of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses.

<P>8.
Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?

<P>9.
Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,

<P>10.
When G-d arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah

<P>11.
 Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee.

<P>12.
 Vow, and pay unto HaShem your G-d; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared;

<P>13.
He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth.-->

<P>2.
 I will lift up my voice unto G-d, an cry; I will lift up my voice unto G-d, that He may give ear unto me.

<P>3.
In the day of my trouble I seek the L-rd; with my hand uplifted, mine eye streameth in the night without ceasing; my soul refuseth to be comforted.

<P>4.
When I think thereon, O G-d, I must moan; when I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth. Selah

<P>5.
Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes; I am troubled, and cannot speak.

<P>6.
I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

<P>7.
In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search:

<P>8.
'Will the L-rd cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more?

<P>9.
Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore?

<P>10.
Hath G-d forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his SOFT-HEARTEDs?' Selah

<P>11.
 And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change.

<P>12.
 I will make mention of the deeds of HaShem; yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old.

<P>13.
I will meditate also upon all Thy work, and muse on Thy doings.'

<P>14.
O G-d, Thy way is in holiness; who is a great god like unto G-d?

<P>15.
Thou art the G-d that doest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.

<P>16.
Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

<P>17.
The waters saw Thee, O G-d; the waters saw Thee, they were in pain; the depths also trembled.

<P>18.
The CLOUDSCLOUDS flooded forth waters; the skies sent out a sound; Thine arrows also went abroad.

<P>19.
The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.

<P>20.
Thy way was in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps were not known.
<P>21.
 Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.-->

<P>2.
 They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

<P>3.
They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.

<P>4.
We are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

<P>5.
How long, O HaShem, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?

<P>6.
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.

<P>7.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.

<P>8.
Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let Thy SOFT-HEARTEDs speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.

<P>9.
Help us, O G-d of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.

<P>10.
Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their G-d?' Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight.

<P>11.
 Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;

<P>12.
 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O L-rd.

<P>13.
So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; we will tell of Thy praise to all generations.-->

 'How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah

<P>3.
Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.

<P>4.
Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.

<P>5.
They know not, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are moved.

<P>6.
I said: Ye are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High.

Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'

 A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.

 O G-d, keep not Thou silence; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O G-d.

<P>3.
For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.

<P>4.
They hold crafty converse against Thy people, and take counsel against Thy treasured ones.

<P>5.
They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'

<P>6.
For they have consulted together with one consent; against Thee do they make a covenant;

<P>7.
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;

<P>8.
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

<P>9.
Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah

<P>10.
Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;

<P>11.
 Who were destroyed at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth.

<P>12.
 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes;

<P>13.
Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of G-d.'

<P>14.
O my G-d, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind.

<P>15.
As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze;

<P>16.
So pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm.

<P>17.
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Thy name, O HaShem.

<P>18.
Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish;

That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is HaShem, the Most High over all the earth.-->

Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O HaShem, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.

 Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah

<P>12.
 Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? or Thy faithfulness in destruction?

Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<P>14.
But as for me, unto Thee, O HaShem, do I cry, and in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.

<P>15.
HaShem, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?

I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.

Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.

<P>1.
 O HaShem, Thou G-d to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou G-d to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.

<P>2.
 Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth; render to the proud their recompense.

<P>3.
HaShem, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?

<P>4.
They gush out, they speak arrogancy; all the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily.

<P>5.
They crush Thy people, O HaShem, and afflict Thy heritage.

<P>6.
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

<P>7.
And they say: 'The HaShem will not see, neither will the G-d of Jacob give heed.'

<P>8.
Consider, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye understand?

<P>9.
He that PUT-IN-PLACE the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?

<P>10.
He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct? even He that teacheth man knowledge?

<P>11.
 HaShem knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

<P>12.
 Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O HaShem, and teachest out of Thy TORAH<a href="Psalms.html#TORAH">*</a>;

<P>13.
That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, until the pit be digged for the wicked.

<P>14.
For HaShem will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance.

<P>15.
For right shall return unto justice, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

<P>16.
Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

<P>17.
Unless HaShem had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence.

<P>18.
If I say: 'My foot slippeth', Thy mercy, O HaShem, holdeth me up.

<P>19.
When my cares are many within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.

<P>20.
Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee, which frameth mischief by LAW NOT INTUITIVE?

<P>21.
 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood.

<P>22.
 But HaShem hath been my high tower, and my G-d the rock of my refuge.

<P>23.
And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil; HaShem our G-d will cut them off.-->

<P>1.
 A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before HaShem.

<P>2.
 O HaShem, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto Thee.

<P>3.
Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.

<P>4.
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.

<P>5.
My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread.

<P>6.
By reason of the voice of my sighing my bones cleave to my flesh.

<P>7.
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.

<P>8.
I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.

<P>9.
Mine enemies taunt me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me.

<P>10.
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

<P>11.
 Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; for Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.

<P>12.
 My days are like a lengthening shadow; and I am withered like grass.

<P>13.
But Thou, O HaShem, sittest enthroned for ever; and Thy name is unto all generations.

<P>14.
Thou wilt arise, and have SOFT-HEARTED upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.

<P>15.
For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.

<P>16.
So the nations will fear the name of HaShem, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory;

<P>17.
When HaShem hath built up Zion, when He hath appeared in His glory;

<P>18.
When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer.

<P>19.
This shall be written for the generation to come; and a people which shall be created shall praise HaShem.

<P>20.
For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven did HaShem behold the earth;

<P>21.
 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

<P>22.
 That men may tell of the name of HaShem in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem;

<P>23.
When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve HaShem.

<P>24.
He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

<P>25.
I say: 'O my G-d, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.

<P>26.
Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.

<P>27.
They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;

<P>28.
But Thou art the selfsame, and Thy years shall have no end.

<P>29.
The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, and their seed shall be established before Thee.'-->

<P>1. <IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/h.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter H" HEIGHT="40">ALLELUJAH<a href="Psalms.html#HALLELUJAH">*</a>! O give thanks unto HaShem; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.

<P>2.
 Who can express the mighty acts of HaShem, or make all His praise to be heard?

<P>3.
Happy are they that keep justice, that do righteousness at all times.

<P>4.
Remember me, O HaShem, when Thou favourest Thy people; O think of me at Thy salvation;

<P>5.
That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, that I may glory with Thine inheritance.

<P>6.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.

<P>7.
Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

<P>8.
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.

<P>9.
And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.

<P>10.
And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<P>11.
 And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.

<P>12.
 Then believed they His words; they sang His praise.

<P>13.
They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;

<P>14.
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried G-d in the desert.

<P>15.
And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

<P>16.
They were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the PURE one of HaShem.

<P>17.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

<P>18.
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

<P>19.
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.

<P>20.
Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.

<P>21.
 They forgot G-d their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;

<P>22.
 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.

<P>23.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.

<P>24.
Moreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;

<P>25.
And they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of HaShem.

<P>26.
Therefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;

<P>27.
And that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.

<P>28.
They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

<P>29.
Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.
30
Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.

<P>31.
 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.

<P>32.
 They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;

<P>33.
For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.


<P>34.
They did not destroy the peoples, as HaShem commanded them;

<P>35.
But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;

<P>36.
And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;

<P>37.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,

<P>38.
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.

<P>39.
Thus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.
40
Therefore was the wrath of HaShem kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.

<P>41.
 And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.

<P>42.
 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.

<P>43.
Many times did He deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.

<P>44.
Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;

<P>45.
And He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.

<P>46.
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.

<P>47.
Save us, O HaShem our G-d, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy PURE name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.

<P>48.
Blessed be HaShem, the G-d of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting, and let all the people say: 'Amen.' Hallelujah.-->

Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto HaShem; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

<P>15.
Let them be before HaShem continually, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

<P>16.
Because that he remembered not to do kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart he was ready to slay.

<P>17.
Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him.

<P>18.
He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment, and it is come into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones.

'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up', let Israel now say;

2
'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; but they have not prevailed against me.
3
The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.
4
HaShem is righteous; He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.'

5
Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion.
6
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it springeth up;
7
Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
8
Neither do they that go by say: 'The blessing of HaShem be upon you; we bless you in the name of HaShem.'-->

Deliver me, O HaShem, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man;
3
Who devise evil things in their heart; every day do they stir up wars.
4
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah
5
Keep me, O HaShem, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to make my steps slip.
6
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah
7
I have said unto HaShem: 'Thou art my G-d'; give ear, O HaShem, unto the voice of my supplications.
8
O GOD the L-rd, the strength of my salvation, who hast screened my head in the day of battle,

9
Grant not, O HaShem, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah
10
As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
11
Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
12
A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; the violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.
13
I know that HaShem will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy.
14
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.-->

<!--<P><A NAME="P142"><B>PSALM 142</B>

<P>1.
 Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.

<P>2.
 With my voice I cry unto HaShem; with my voice I make supplication unto HaShem.

<P>3.
I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble;

<P>4.
When my spirit fainteth within me--Thou knowest my path--in the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me.

<P>5.
Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man that knoweth me; I have no way to flee; no man careth for my soul.

<P>6.
I have cried unto Thee, O HaShem; I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.'

<P>7.
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me.

<P>8.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Thy name; the righteous shall crown themselves because of me; for Thou wilt deal bountifully with me.-->

<P>2.
 And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.

<P>3.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath crushed my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.

<P>4.
And my spirit fainteth within me; my heart within me is appalled.

<P>5.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing; I muse on the work of Thy hands.

<P>6.
I spread forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee, as a weary land. Selah

<P>7.
Answer me speedily, O HaShem, my spirit faileth; hide not Thy face from me; lest I become like them that go down into the pit.

<P>8.
Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning, for in Thee do I trust; cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.

<P>9.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O HaShem; with Thee have I hidden myself.

<P>10.
Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my G-d; let Thy good spirit lead me in an even land.

<P>11.
