<P>The Torah is removed from the Ark and presented to the reader, who accepts it in his right arm. Facing the congregation the reader raises the Torah and, followed by congregation, recites:

<LI><a name="9">GROUP-WANDER - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, are held as if to contain the group and the hands move away together in a random pattern as if wandering with <U>th</U>.

<LI><a name="10">(2h)F-CL'staves perpendicular to body' - (2h)[F], POs >&lt;, FOs down, start at respective sides of the body and move ouward to show the handles.

<LI><a name="11">(2h)1-CL'@ each corner' (2h)S-CL'bear on shoulder' CARRY'forward' - (2h)[1], POs away, FOs up, show the two people on the left side of the ark (front and back) and then the two on the right + (2h)[S] are positioned as if holding a stave over the shoulder + (2h)[1], POs up, show something being carried forward at shoulder level.

<LI><a name="12">GROUP-MOVE-FORWARD - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are cupped together and moved forward to show action as a group.

<LI><a name="12A">MOSES - M-LAW.

<LI><a name="14">BLOW-TOP - [5], PO down, FO away, slaps top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and then moves upwards while DH swivels at the wrist.

<LI><a name="15">OFF-POINT-TO-lf-AND-rt - DH [S], PO > NDS, flicks finger off to the left and then to the right.

<LI><a name="16">(CONTINUE PRAY QUIET) - This is meant to be signed, but it is really a comment from the interpreter to describe to the Deaf people what is happening in the service.

<LI><a name="18">GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which - on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

Personally, I like the Reform way of saying "forefathers and foremothers" so a way you could do this it to use your nondominant hand to sign GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER simultaneously with GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER and add (2h)LONG-LONG-AGO.

<LI><a name="34">MORE-AND-MORE - MORE is signed twice but with the NDH kept in place.

<LI><a name="35">(1-OF-4), (2-OF-4), (3-OF-4), and so on -  NDH [4], PO > signer, FO > DS, and DH taps index finger for "(1-OF-4)", taps middle finger for "(2-OF-4)", and similarly with the ring finger and little finger.

<LI><a name="36">FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, - held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below.

<LI><a name="43">SWEAR - (2h)[B], NDH held on imaginary Bible and DH held up in oath. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/I/W1770.htm">ASL browser - inauguration</A>.

<LI><a name="44">PASSOVER - [S] taps thumbside against elbow (like CRACKER). For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0801.htm">ASL browser - cracker</A>.
