<LI><a name="2">THRONE - SIT + (2h)[B:], POs down, FOs away, behave as if they were on the arms of a throne. 

<LI><a name="3">ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.

<LI><a name="4">UPRIGHT - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly in the palm of NDH [B].

Personally, I like the Reform way of saying "forefathers and foremothers" so a way you could do this it to use your nondominant hand to sign GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER simultaneously with GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER and add (2h)LONG-LONG-AGO.  

<LI><a name="11">LIFT-UP - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven.

<LI><a name="12">MORE-THAN - (2h)[B^], touch FTs, then DH moves up in an arc towards the signer and away. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/M/W2393.htm">ASL browser - more than</A>.

<LI><a name="18">THEREABOUTS - [5], PO down, FO away, circles parllel to the floor.

<LI><a name="19">#ALL-OF-YOU - [A], PO up, FO > DS is held at DS then swings away in an arc and ends [L^], PO up, FO > NDS.

<LI><a name="20">LONG-LIST - (2h)[O^], POs > signer, NDH is above and touches DH; both hands open to (2h)[5] while DH descends.

<LI><a name="21">(1-OF-3), (2-OF-3), (3-OF-3) -  NDH [3], PO > signer, FO > DS, and DH taps thumb for "(1-OF-3)", taps index finger for "(2-OF-3)", and taps middle finger for "(3-OF-3).

<LI><a name="22">INDEX-LIST-OF-3 (4 or 5)  - NDH [3] or whatever number of items are on the list, PO > signer, FO > DS, and DH points thumb, then moves > DS and down, then points to the index finger, and similarly with the middle finger to say we are referring to all the previously listed items.

<LI><a name="23">PURE - Like CLEAN but the intensive form that moves slightly > NDS, pauses, then rushes to the DS.

<LI><a name="24">EACH-OTHER - (2h)[A dot], thumbs circle one another with DH thumb pointing down and NDH thumb pointing upwards.
