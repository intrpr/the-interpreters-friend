<P><B>Glossing techniques (Cokely-Baker)</B>
<ol>
<LI>Vocabulary items are listed with the English term uncapitalized, a colon, 			and the gloss in bolded upper case letters. 
<LI>Initialized signs are indicated by the substituted handshape, a dash, and the base sign. Again this assumes that the gloss for the base sign is known to the target audience.
<LI>Fingerspelled vocabulary is treated the same as vocabulary that has a sign and is indicated by bolded upper case letters separated by dashes. A single 			fingerspelled letter is enclosed in quotes.
<LI>More context for the vocabulary item is provided by additional words in 			parentheses.
<LI>Signs that are generated by repetition of base signs, are indicated with a plus sign.
<LI>Signs that are blends of other signs can be represented by a tilda (~).
<LI>If a sign uses parts of the body as a direct object, the sign is followed by a dash and the body part described in lower case letters.
<LI>If spatialization and directionality are used, lf, rt, ctr can be used for &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and &quot;center&quot;.
</ol><BR>

<P><B>More detailed description (Cokely-Baker, Bar-Tzur)</B>
<P>For signs that can not be related to signs that have a standard gloss, a more complex system is used. 
<BR><ol>
<LI>If the sign is two-handed and the handshapes are the same, (2h) is used and 		then the handshape is enclosed in square brackets.
<LI>If two-handed, but the handshapes are different, DH (dominant hand) is used, indicating the handshape, later listing NDH (non-dominant hand). NDH may be 	omitted since the other handshape must now be on the NDH.  
<LI>Palm orientations are specified: PO up, PO down, PO > NDS (non-	dominant), 		PO > DS (dominant), PO towards (towards signer), PO away (away from signer), 	POs &gt;&lt; (palms face each other). 
<LI>FO specifies fingertip orientation, similarly to PO. Remember FO is defined in linguistics as the direction the fingertips would point if they were extended, not based on a closed HS. 
<LI>If handshapes are used as classifiers, information showing how the classifier moves is described in single quotes.
<LI>If the NDH stays in place from a previous sign while the DH continues a new 		sign, a dashed arrow can show the duration of the hold.
