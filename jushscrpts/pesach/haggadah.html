<P><H2>Pesach (Passover) Haggadah - excerpts<a href="haggadah.html#A"><sup>A</sup></a></H2>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> translated into ASL by David Bar-Tzur</B></CENTER>

<P>Before the seder begins, you may wish to ask the Seder leader to pause when explaining the foods on the table and their symbolic meaning so that all the deaf people will have a clear picture of what is being referred to that is physically on the table, before the leader goes on to the next food item. If the Seder follows Orthodox tradition, there will be a lengthy explanation of how to wash hands and how to eat the matzah and the Hillel sandwich, because one may not speak from the time of washing the hands until the eating of the Hillel sandwich. Again, you may wish to ask the seder leader to give you time to intepret all the instructions and make everything clear before people start to wash their hands. Since some of the songs are very fast, you may wish to write out or use my translations of the songs so that you do not get behind, since part of the fun of the Seder is to sing <I>Had Gadya</I> and some of the other songs as fast as possible (and even faster).
