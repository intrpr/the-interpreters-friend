<P><A NAME="CHANUKAH">6.1 Chanukah
	
<P>Please read Chapter 1, Section 3.2 [1.3.2 Being yotze or motzi a deaf person for spoken mitzvot], 1.3.4 on inclusion of deaf people in a minyan, and review Chapter 2 on preparation and performance strategies. Chanukah is not a full holiday, so you do not need to concern yourself with prohibited actions concerning lights, food, money, etc. It's quite likely that there will be singing, so prepare yourself with translations if possible.

<P><A NAME="purim">6.2 Purim

<P>Please read Chapter 1, Section 3.2 [1.3.2 Being yotze or motzi a deaf person for spoken mitzvot], which deals with a deaf person’s obligation to hear Megillat Ester read, 1.3.4 on inclusion of deaf people in a minyan,  and review Chapter 2 on preparation and performance strategies.

<P>6.2.1 Megillah for Purim

<P>Purim is not a full holiday, so you do not need to concern yourself with prohibited actions concerning lights, food, money, etc. The focus of the service will be the megillah reading, a translation of which is featured in the link above. One of the challenges of the megillah is that when the name of the villain Haman is mentioned, everyone in the congregations will boo him by making noises. The problem with this is that it is difficult to sign a translation and have the exact moment that Haman is mentioned in the megillah match with your interpretation. You might warn the Deaf congregants about this and simply pause or speed up to have the "Haman"s match.

<P>Blessings before the Megillah reading

<P>WE PRAISE ADONAI, OUR GOD, RULE WORLD. WHY? YOU MAKE US PURE THROUGH YOUR MITZVOT AND COMMAND US READ MEGILLAH.

<P>WE PRAISE ADONAI, OUR GOD, RULE WORLD. WHY? LONG-AGO SHOW-TO-us JEWISH PEOPLE, MIRACLE GO-IN-CYCLES, ARRIVE AGAIN, CELEBRATE.

<P>WE PRAISE ADONAI, OUR GOD, RULE WORLD. WHY? (1-OF-3) GIFT-TO US LIFE, (2-OF-3) HELP US BE-STRONG, (3-OF-3) ALLOW US ARRIVE NOW+ TIME-PERIOD.

<LI><a name="62">(CONGREGATION MOCK-rt) - Each time that Haman's name is mentioned during the Megillah reading, the congregation (same sign as AUDIENCE) will make noise by hooting or using noisemakers to drown out Haman's name. This forces the reader to stop because it is a mitzvah (each Jew is obligated) to hear every word of the megillah. The signs in the parentheses is meant to inform the Deaf people why everyone is making noise. The first time it happens, I continue to sign mock as long as the congregation is holding up the reading. Afterwards it is up to the interpreter whether they want to do so or not. Being Jewish, I usually have a noisemaker myself and the second time and onwards, I pick up my noisemaker and join in on the rucusness rather than sign CONGREGATION MOCK each time. Either way is fine. People will sometimes shout out original things like "Death to Haman!" (HAMAN DIE MUST!) which I will interpret also.
