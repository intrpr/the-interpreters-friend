<P>Many signs do not have a standardized gloss. Some of the glosses I have chosen for a given sign may throw you off because you would not label it the same way. For that reason, and also to show you some signs you may not have seen before, this book comes with a DVD that demonstrates each of the signs that I feel may be new to some readers. I have chosen as a standard all the signs that I had not yet learned as part of my interpreter preparation program. 

<P>I have also included this appendix for those times that you do not have access to the DVD or something that could play it. Please read Appendix A to understand the notations used in this Appendix. Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated in the worship service scripts. 

<P>Besides the signs that appear in my translation of the various services, I have included signs for terms that might come up as part of a drasha (sermon), shiur (religious classroom learning), or other presentation about Jewish topics. If the word is all uppercase (for example AARON), then it is a gloss that appears in this book. If it is not (for example Acre), then it is a term that might appear in a Jewish setting, but is not in my translations per se. 

<P>To see what the DVD will look like, go to <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=04839BA20DD214C0">YouTube - David Bar-Tzur playlists: Sign dictionaries.</A>
