<P>4.1 Introduction
	
<P>Please review Chapter 1, Section 3.1 (1.3.1 Use of a hearing aid on Shabbat) which also applies to the High Holidays, Chapter 2 on preparation and performance strategies, and 3.1 and 3.2 on Shabbat. The High Holiday services, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, are the most heavily attended of all Jewish Services, and so the likelihood is high that you might be called on to do them. This also means that often the hearing and Deaf congregants are less familiar with the service. In other words they only come to worship once a year. One strategy is to share with the deaf people, five signs that you will use that they might not be familiar with: perhaps how you will sign Rosh Hashana, shofar, Yom Kippur, repent, and sin. If any of they have questions about these concepts, before the worship service starts would be a great time to explain. Besides the etiquette mentioned in 3.2, don’t be obvious in the place of worship that you are eating something, even slipping gum or candy into your mouth on stage, on Yom Kippur, which is a fast day. 

<P>4.1.1 Sounding the shofar
	
<P>The way I represent the sounding of the shofar is to hold an [S] with the non-dominant hand at the mouth to represent the mouth piece and a [C] where the end of the shofar might be and move both hands slightly away from the face in imitation of the frequencies of the blasts. You don’t have to memorize anything because I think it is distracting to fingerspell the names of the blasts, and you can move this shofar classifier to the beats you hear as you hear them. There are three different kinds of blasts: (1) Tekiah is a single blast that lasts about 3 seconds. At the end of the blast you can give the hands a slight nod forward. (2) Truah is a series of about ten short blasts. Vibrate the hands for as long as the ba’al tekiah [the person sounding the shofar] blasts and then a slight nod at the end. (3) Shevarim is a series of three medium length blasts. Move the hands away three times.
	
<P>Here we return to a summary of Rabbi Mordechai Shuchatowitz’ article “Halacha concerning Jewish Deaf and Hard of Hearing”. On Rosh Hashana [Jewish New Year], it is a mitzvah to hear the blowing of the shofar. This represents God’s power to rule the universe as well as a call for the hearers to repent. The sound of the shofar must be actually heard without alteration or amplification. If a person is unable to hear at all, s/he can not be yotze by blowing the shofar for his/herself and therefore cannot be motzi others. Listening to the shofar with amplification is problematic, because it produces an electronic reproduction, and alterations of the sound prevent a person from being yotze, such as listening only to an echo of this sound or if the shofar is covered with gold or other foreign materials.
	
<P>Those who are totally deaf are not obligated (and unable) to perform this mitzvah, although it is in the spirit of the holiday to attend services. These are the options available to those who have some hearing in order of most desirable to most questionable, (1) use some form of ear horn, such as a paper cone, to focus the sound of the shofar on the ear canal, (2) stand as close as possible to the shofar using no electronic amplification, and (3) some people say that one can be yotze listening to a shofar blast using personal electronic amplification, but this is the least desirable option in terms of halacha. (4) I have heard of a congregant holding onto the <I>shfar</I> as it is being sounded, assuming that the <I>Baal Shofat</I> [the person sounding it is willing] or using a baloon to feel the vibrations. I don't know if this is a better option than 3  or worse.
