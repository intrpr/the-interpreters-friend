<P>3.1 Introduction

<P>Shabbat [the Sabbath] is the weekly celebration of God's creation of the universe and an imitation of His rest to consider what He had done. We Jews have an opportunity to put aside the weekday world and consider spiritual matters. Please review Chapter 1, Section 3 [1.3] about deaf people's obligations on Shabbat, 1.3.2 on being yotze or motzi a deaf person for spoken mitzvot, 1.3.4 on inclusion of deaf people in a minyan, and Chapter 2 on preparation and performance strategies.

<P>It may seem out of place to mention it here, but I couldn't find a better place to mention that it is helpful to announce each new page you interpret, even if the prayer leader is not doing so. This may be difficult if the service is only in Hebrew, but in English the leader assumes that the congregation can hear the English and know which page they are on. Because we are presumable not using some manual code for English it may not be so easy for the deaf person to do so. Some deaf people don't care which page it is and will just watch the interpreter during the entire service. Other deaf people will sometimes look at the Siddur [prayer book], perhaps to compare the written English and what the interpreter is signing, and so they will want to know which page everyone is on at the moment.

<P>3.1.1 How much to interpret
	
<P>When I used to do regular Orthodox Shabbat services, the Deaf congregant only wanted me to interpret the sermon and announcements and would otherwise sit next to me and I would show him where we were in the service by pointing to the spot on the page for important transitions. From the Shmoneh Esreh [standing, silent prayer] to the end of the services, I would run my finger across the words in Hebrew to give him more of a sense of the progress of the services. If the consumer is of the opposite gender and there is separate seating, s/he could follow along by looking at her neighbor, since people are usually friendly enough to show someone the page. Check with the Deaf person as to THEIR expectations. 

<P>3.1.2 Scripts
	
<P>If you will be doing more of the service than the sermon and announcements, you will need to consider the liturgy, that is, a ritualized form that is written down and followed exactly. For those parts of the service that you will be doing repeatedly, are spoken aloud, and are "more important", it's wise to write out a glossed script that you can follow so that your interpretation will become frozen, that is, be identical each time. For many religious people this exact repetition is part of their feeling of connecting with the spiritual. Appendix B, which explains how I have glossed these scripts, may give you some ideas as to how you could gloss your script.	                                             	

<P>This scripting could be done progressively, doing a small portion for the first few times, then a bit more for the next few times, and so on. I would suggest starting with (1) the Amidah or Shmoneh Esreh [Standing silent prayer] for Shacharit [the morning service] and Musaf [the additional morning service on Shabbat and Yom Tov], later do (2) Kaddish [the Sanctification of God's name] and Adon Olam [the closing hymn], still later (3) the Torah reading service (not the weekly reading itself but what is said just before, between, and after), later (4) Borchu [call to worship] to the Shmoneh Esreh, and later (5) from the end of Musaf to the end of the entire service. Later in this chapter you will see scripts I have written for Shabbat. Other chapters offer scripts for other settings.                               	

<P>There are several advantages to having a script to interpret from rather than doing a sight translation, that is interpreting as you read from the Siddur. (1) We are used to hearing not reading the message and it is somewhat awkward. (2) Once you determine pretty much how you want to sign specific portions, you will approach a sense of frozen text for the consumer, rather than being different every week. Some variation is of course to be expected. (3) Liturgical English is often old-fashioned, of a complex structure, and full of passives: "Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted, extolled, mighty, upraised, and lauded be the Name of the Holy One, Blessed is He." [<I>Birnbaum</I> and Artscroll] (4) You can spend your energy on trying to produce a poetically signed message, rather than struggling with how to produce a semantically equivalent one. (5) You can remind yourself of how much you need to tailor make your interpretation/translation to fit the understanding of the Deaf congregant and to what extent do you need to expand on the meaning of Jewish culturally rich terms.                                  	     	

<P>To give you some idea of the complexities of translating liturgical languages, let's take the example of the phrase most frequently encountered in Jewish liturgy: Barukh atah Hashem, Eloheinu melekh haolam. One of the standard translations of this is "Blessed art thou, Lord Our God, King of the Universe." [Birnbaum] The first word already offers problems. "Blessed" is a passive construction, so that means someone is blessing God. Who might that be? I can see how God blesses us, but how do we or anyone else for that matter bless God? Perhaps it would make sense to translate it as "we praise you" or "we thank you".         	

<P>Hashem literally means "the Name" and is used to avoid writing out Adonai [my Lord(s)] which is a circumlocution for pronouncing YHWH. YHWH is one of many names for God and is related to the concept of "Eternal" and connotes mercy as oppose to Elohim which means "God" and is in the plural to show His strength and strict justice, because it also means "judge(s)". Signing some form of "Lord" is judged by some Deaf Jews to be too Christian, and this is a theme you will see played out with hearing and signing-impaired Jews who avoid spoken English when talking about things Jewish. They won't say, "Thank God" or "Praise the Lord" because it sounds too Christian; they say "Barukh Hashem" only. there is a movement among Deaf Jews active in Judaism to use the honorific index, where the upturned palm is pointed high and swept to one side. For God, the traditional sign GOD could be used although some Deaf people believe its etymology is connected with the cross, which I believe is mistaken, but there you have it.                            	

<P>Reform and Reconstructionist Jews want to avoid sexist language, so they don't like "Lord", which is obviously male. Hebrew is very gender oriented and there is no neuter. there can be no doubt that God is treated as masculine in Jewish liturgy and it is strange to hear Reform services translate the liturgy in gender neutral terms and then repeat the same portion in Hebrew where it is still obviously in the masculine. For a while I translated the "Eternal" translation which appears in places with the interesting sign where the familiar sign FOREVER is a two-handed sign that has the non-dominant hand move backwards over the shoulder. Now that I have adopted the honorific index sign, which has no gender connotation like the sign LORD does, I can use it for Reform and Reconstructionist services.                                        	

<P>Similarly for Melekh haolam, I used to sign YOURSELF KING RULE UNIVERSE, but I have found that this phrase is said so frequently and so rapidly that the best translation I have found for the entire phrase is WE PRAISE ADONAI OUR GOD RULE UNIVERSE. Notice that "you" is missing because it is included in the sweeping honorific index, which I am glossing as ADONAI, and "you" is added back as YOURSELF. "King" is also missing from this translation as denotation [direct statement] but the concept remains as a connotation [indirect statement] with the sign RULE, by which I mean the sign CONTROL but I mouth "rule". Some interpreters prefer to silently Sim-Com the Hebrew through the service.                   	

<P>A second phrase that is often joined to this first one is asher qideshanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu... ["who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us" – Birnbaum or "who hallows us with His mitzvot, and command us" – Gates of Prayer]. Qadosh, which is usually translated as "holy", is another word that some object to being translated by this traditional English word or the parallel sign HOLY. Signs that have been suggested are SEPARATE, SPECIAL or PURE. I choose to use the last one myself. "Commandments", some feels does not convey the beautiful actions that Jews perform to show THEIR love of Hashem, and "commandments" has the connotation of drudgery and subjugation. A sign has been devised, which we shall gloss as MITZVAH which is (2h)[M], POs down, FOs away, move antisymmetrically from side to side. Remember to see Appendix A for an explanation of all glossings. I translate this phrase as HIMSELF MAKE US PURE THROUGH HIS MITZVAH AND COMMAND US…

<P>3.1.3 Torah reading                              	

<P>The Shabbat worship service includes a reading from the Torah [the Five Books of Moses]. It is divided into fifty-four parshiyot [sections], so that the Torah is read aloud in its entirety once every year. You will need to find out which Parsha is being read for the Shabbat you will be interpreting so that you can have the text ready in a form that is easy to work with. Orthodox and Conservative services will read the entire Parsha, but other movements may pick an abbreviated form, so if you go on the Web to find the Parsha of the week, this will work for the first kind of service, but you should contact the temple for the other kind of service, since it will vary from congregation to congregation.                  	

<P>The place of worship will have a book separate from the Siddur, called a Chumash that has the readings for each week. It may not be convenient to sight translate from it, so you may wish to print a copy with larger font by finding it on the Web. I will sometimes write out a translation of the Pasha into ASL, but that is because I don't have to do it every week. It is a lot of work, but if you do the services weekly you may want to slowly work on a translation bit by bit for ease of performance. A modified approach I use is to read through the copy of the Parsha I got from the Web and use Word to rewrite those sections of the reading that are particular difficult to sight translate because they need a lot of restructuring or expansion [inserting an explanation of terms that may be unfamiliar to my Deaf audience]. The Torah scroll may be read from a different place in the synagogue, such as in the middle of the congregation. People usually don't turn to watch the Torah reading, so it is not necessary to move to that area, but this should be discussed with your clients.												

<P>Often the reason that you have been asked to interpret for Shabbat, assuming this is not an on-going assignment, is because there is a Bar/Bat mitzvah [celebration of a girl or boy becoming an adult in Jewish law]. Chapter 5 deals with this in detail as well as other rites of passage. The focus of a Bar/Bat mitzvah is usually the Parsha, which is read by the celebrant, so you may want to work on at least a partial translation.

<P>3.1.4 Sermon
	
<P>For the sermon and most of the service, the interpreter should be close to the rabbi or in the front section where the Ark is. Rabbis are often loath to have you too close to them and distract the audience. They may cite tircha d'tzibbura [discomforting the congregation] as the reason, but usually congregation enjoy watching the interpreter occasionally and trying to figure out how the Sign Language might be related to what the Rabbi is saying, especially if they are bored. I don't fight it, but I do try to figure out a compromise, such as being on a chair on the congregation floor but near or in from of them. Try to get a copy of the sermon if you can, or at least an oral summary from the rabbi. 

<P>3.1.5 Kiddush
	
<P>After the service, many congregants may greet you with "Git Shabbos (Good Sabbath)" or "Shabbat Shalom (Peace of the Sabbath)". It is appropriate to respond by either repeating what they said or using the other of the two greetings just mentioned. In some congregations the rabbi makes Kiddush as discussed in 1.3.2 while still in the sanctuary where services were held. The congregants will then retire to the social hall for a light snack. The interpreter should ask the consumer if s/he wants the interpreter to go to the social hall as well. This time after the services is also called Kiddush and the rabbi may wait until people are in the social hall and make it from there. 							

<P>This gathering is merely social, but it is a time for people to get to know one another and you could serve as a conduit of sociability. If the rabbi makes Kiddush in the social hall, don't eat or drink anything until after s/he is finished. Wine and snacks are served, perhaps bread with a brochah [blessing]. If you want to avoid wine, there is grape juice. The rabbi may say a brochah achronah afterwards, and it would be good if you had the text for that so you could interpret it. You can find a translation of this in Chapter 10.

<P>3.2 General worship etiquette

<P>3.2.1 Dress
	
<P>The appropriate dress for any Orthodox setting is formal. Suits for men and very modest dresses for women, that is, long sleeves, covered knees, and no décolletage [nothing showing below the neck]. This is best even for Conservative and Reform settings, although one might be able to get away with less. Married Orthodox women cover THEIR hair, but this is often a wig, so the female interpreter does not have to do anything special with her hair. Women in some Reform and Reconstructionist congregations want to wear a kippah [skull cap] to be on par with the men, and may wear a tallit [prayer shawl], which is not done among Orthodox women. The female interpreter might be asked to do the same. 	

<P>The male interpreter should find a kippah (whether Jewish or not) and a tallit (if he is Jewish) for himself in all Orthodox, Conservative and Reconstructionist congregations and in many Reform ones as well, if a sign is so posted. I have to admit that I find it difficult to interpret with a tallit on because the waving of my hands keeps making it fall off. I prefer not to wear one, but if pressured I will loop it over once at the neck (not tie it in a knot). Neither gender should openly wear the symbol of another faith, such as a cross or crucifix. 

<P>3.2.2 Shabbat and Yom Tov [Holiday] prohibitions
	
<P>The interpreter does not generally have to be Jewish or religious to interpret in these settings, although some consumers like this, but s/he should not openly violate any of the Shabbat or Yom Tov [Holiday] prohibitions while being in the place of worship. This is a good policy for any of the movements, since many are returning to keeping rituals even in the more liberal groups. there are many prohibitions that are meant to focus a Jew on the spiritual, but interpreters need principally be aware of writing, handling money (or carrying a purse) and talking about everyday business. Do not take photographs. Don't write down information such as reminders or phone numbers where people can see you. It takes people's minds away from a state of rest and takes one back to the workaday world. Don't discuss or handle money openly, and therefore don't present a bill for services to anyone in the synagogue: mail it in. 

<P>3.2.3 Money matters outside of Shabbat
	
<P>Even when it is not Shabbat, religious people may have the attitude that you should volunteer, because it is a spiritual matter. Rabbis don't volunteer, so you don't have to volunteer either. I do sometimes volunteer for Jewish events, because they are my beloved community, but if there is a way to get funding for an event or ongoing service, I would help the place of worship figure out how to tap into it, not only for myself but for the benefit of interpreters who come in the future. Possible funding avenues are: using discretionary funds in the budget, using special needs funds in the budget, or seeking donors or grants.

<P>It is wise to find out who hired you for an event. Was it the place of worship, the Deaf person him/herself, or a congregant that has a deaf relative? Perhaps it will be an open audience, where the event does not know of any specific deaf people who will come, but want to offer access to anyone that might come. In such a situation you may wish to speak to the contact person about advertising strategies. It may be too late for this event, but it would be good for them to know in the future so that THEIR money is well spent. If one place of worship is not willing to provide an interpreter for every Shabbat, perhaps the Deaf person could find several places of worship that would be willing to foot the bill.

<P><B>3.4 Reform worship service scripts – See Appendix A to explain gloss, Appendix B for specific signs</B>
											
<P>A Reform service, even in the same temple, may have several different versions of the worship service in the same book. It may also skip pages depending on the preference of the prayer leader, so I have used a specific prayer book and indicated the page numbers. This version is from Stern, C. (ed., 1994), Gates of Prayer for Shabbat and weekdays: A gender sensitive prayerbook. New York: Central Conference of American Rabbis. This prayer book divides the service into many short portions. They are recited first in Hebrew, and then repeated in English. Some English texts are not translations or adaptations, but original Reform writings.                                               

<P>Since most of what is said in Hebrew may be repeated in English (unlike Traditional synagogues), you might ask and indeed I asked myself, why translate it into ASL? Why not just let the interpreter wait for the English or sight translate [interpret by reading the written text] from the English while the reader says the Hebrew? At the beginning of this chapter I already offered reasons why sight translation is less than optimal, and some of these are true even if the prayer leader is speaking English. In addition are two other reasons that don't apply to sight translation: (1) it is sometimes hard to understand the congregation when they are reading the English because of THEIR staggered [non-simultaneous] voices, and (2) the words may be drawn out when chanted or sung and this allows the interpreter to keep a prosodic pace that makes sense in ASL, rather than waiting for the leader to finish a phrase. 

<P>The signs "||:" and ":||" show where the various repetitions (first in Hebrew and then in English) begin and end. You may be tempted to simply not interpret when the Hebrew is being spoken and use this translation when the English is said. This probably won't work very well because there are some rather long portions where you will be standing silent for a while. This looks rather unaesthetic to me, especially when portions are being sung, and then merely spoken afterwards in English translation. It is also culturally insensitive because Deaf people are reminded of the oft-repeated phrase, "I'll tell you later", and then never told. Better to interpret the Hebrew slowly and clearly and be silent for some of the English if necessary. 	        	

<P>The italicized portions you will find in this section show where the congregation reads aloud. This is the notation used in the Stern prayer book and also may be more difficult to hear, since the voices will be staggered. This prayer book is intended to be gender neutral, so I have glossed the honorific index, here pointing to God with upturned palm as <U>INDEX</U>, rather than <U>SHE/HE</U>, and <U>POSSESSIVE</U> instead of <U>HER/HIS</U>. The irony is not lost on me that the original Hebrew prayers that they use in this book still retains the masculine case, such as Melekh [King], but there is no neuter case in Hebrew; everything is either masculine or feminine.
