<BR><U>th</U>
<DIR>the tongue sticks out slightly while the mouth forms the phoneme "th", showing carelessness or inattentiveness to detail or rightness</DIR>
<BR>VERB-TO-me, us
<DIR>The sign whic normally moves away from the signer, moves towards the signer to show the action is happening to "me" or "us"; an example being HAVE-MERCY-ON-us, which as the sign usually glossed PITY, moves towards the signer and not away</DIR>
<BR>[V:]
<DIR>the colon means curl the fingertips of the handshape, as in BLIND</DIR>
<BR>wg
<DIR>wiggle fingers</DIR>
<BR>[X]
<DIR>a letter or number inside brackets indicates handshape</DIR>
<BR>[X dot]
<DIR>handshape is modified by extending thumb</DIR>
<BR>[X^]
<DIR>the handshape is modified so that fingers are held at 90º angle to 	palm, as in B^-CL</DIR>
<BR>X,Y
<DIR>first handshape is for NDH, second is for DH, as in "leak from hole": 	F,4-CL</DIR>
<BR>X>Y
<DIR>first handshape becomes second handshape as in "disappear into the distance": G>bO-CL</DIR>
<BR>(1h)
<DIR>one hand is used instead of the usual two-handed sign</DIR>
<BR>1x, 2x, 3x
<DIR>once, twice, three times (sometimes notated x1, x2, x3); used instead of + when sign is usually produced twice, but now once (or vice versa), or in descriptions that do not use the gloss, so there is no sign to add + to</DIR>
<BR>(2h)
<DIR>both hands have the same handshape or the usual one-handed sign is produced with both hands</DIR>
<BR>[5:]
<DIR>the colon means curl the fingertips of the handshape</DIR>
<BR>[5^]
<DIR>the carot (^) means bend the fingers at the knuckles, but keep them straight as in the final position of SUNSHINE</DIR>
<BR>@
<DIR>at, as in "brain surgery": PERFORM-SURGERY@temple</DIR>
<BR>:
<DIR>The fingertips are curled as in [5:] for ANGRY</DIR>
<BR>#
<DIR>lexicalized fingerspelling (previously called fingerspelled loan sign)</DIR>
<BR>*
<DIR>sign is executed with a single, short, forceful movement</DIR>
<BR>
<DIR>towards, as in > DS; without further explanation</DIR>
<BR>>&lt;
<DIR>face each other, as in POs >&lt;</DIR>
<BR>^
<DIR>the handshape is modified so that fingers are held at 90º angle to 	palm, as in B^-CL</DIR>
<BR>+
<DIR>it combines sign descriptions with sign glosses to avoid confusstion as in "missionary": [M], FO > DS, circles heart + AGENT</DIR>
<BR>+-
<DIR>sign is repeated while moving in direction indicated: as in +-> DS, +-	up, +-down, +-away, +-towards</DIR>
<BR>~
<DIR>the two signs are blended together smoothly</DIR>
<BR>(<) GLOSS1, (>) GLOSS2
<DIR>sway body to NDS and sign GLOSS1, then sway body to DS and sign GLOSS2</DIR> 

<P><B>Glossing techniques (Cokely-Baker)</B>

<P>* Vocabulary items are listed with the English term uncapitalized, a colon, and the gloss in bolded upper case letters.
<BR>* Initialized signs are indicated by the substituted handshape, a dash, and the base sign. Again this assumes that the gloss for the base sign is known to the target audience.
<BR>* Fingerspelled vocabulary is treated the same as vocabulary that has a sign and is indicated by bolded upper case letters separated by dashes. A single fingerspelled letter is enclosed in quotes.
<BR>* More context for the vocabulary item is provided by additional words in parentheses.
<BR>* Signs that are generated by repetition of base signs, are indicated with a plus sign.
<BR>* Signs that are blends of other signs can be represented by a tilda (~).
<BR>* If a sign uses parts of the body as a direct object, the sign is followed by a dash and the body part described in lower case letters.
<BR>* If spatialization and directionality are used, lf, rt, ctr can be used for "left", "right", and "center".

<P><B>More detailed description (Cokely-Baker, Bar-Tzur)</B>

<P>For signs that cannot be related to signs that have a standard gloss, a more complex system is used. 

<P>* If the sign is two-handed and the handshapes are the same, (2h) is used and then the handshape is enclosed in square brackets.
<BR>* If two-handed, but the handshapes are different, DH (dominant hand) is used, indicating the handshape, later listing NDH (non-dominant hand).     <BR>* NDH may be omitted since the other handshape must now be on the NDH.
<BR>* Palm orientations are specified: PO up, PO down, PO > NDS (non-dominant), PO > DS (dominant), PO towards (towards signer), PO away (away from signer), POs >< (palms face each other).
<BR>* FO specifies fingertip orientation, similarly to PO. Remember FO is defined in linguistics as the direction the fingertips would point if they were extended, not based on a closed HS.
<BR>* If handshapes are used as classifiers, information showing how the classifier moves is described in single quotes.
<BR>* If the NDH stays in place from a previous sign while the DH continues a new sign, a dashed arrow can show the duration of the hold.
