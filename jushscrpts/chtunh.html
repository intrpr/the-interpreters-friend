<P>When the groom reaches the canopy, the cantor sings:

<P>BLESS <U>HE</U>-groom HIMSELF COME. <U>HE</U>-God POWERFUL MORE-THAN<a href="chtunh.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> (2h)#ALL<a href="chtunh.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a>, <U>HE</U>-God WE BLESS MORE-THAN (2h)#ALL, <U>HE</U>-God WONDERFUL MORE-THAN (2h)#ALL, REALLY-WANT<a href="chtunh.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> <U>HIM</U> BLESS TWO-OF-THEM SOON (&lt;) HUSBAND, (>) WIFE.

<P>The rabbi conducting the service holds a cup of wine and recites:

Guests and couple: AMEN.  

<P>Bride and groom drink from the wine.  The groom holds his ring ready to place on the bride's right index finger and says to her:

<P>RING FOR-FOR?  PROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP HOLY, ITSELF FOLLOW JEWISH POSS.+,  MOSES<a href="chtunh.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> PASS-DOWN.

<P>After the ring is placed on the bride's finger, the ketubah (marriage contract) is read aloud and handed to the groom who presents it to the bride. (The interpreter should secure a translation of this document for interpretation.) Then a second cup of wine is poured and the following blessings are recited:
