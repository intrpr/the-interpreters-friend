<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern. 

<P>LIBERATE - Starts like PRESSURE, DH [B], PO down, FO away, push down slightly on [S], PO > DS, FO away, then the DH is brought upwards suddenly and the signer mouths "off". 

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder. 

<P>RISE - GET-UP.

<P>REIGN - CONTROL.

<P>MORE-THAN - (2h)[B^], touch FTs, then DH moves up in an arc towards the signer and away. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/M/W2393.htm">ASL browser - more than</A>. 

<P>SAVIOR - S-FREE AGEN.

<P>GIVE-UP~OFFER-UP - Sign SURRENDER and then OFFER-UP. 

<P>PUT-ON - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, alt. circle perpendicular to the chest with thumbs brushing against chest when they come hear the body. 

<P>FAITH - Like THINK TRUST but with elevated hands and eyes to show the trust is spiritual. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&Letter=F">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Faith.</A> 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I have seen the Lord, I have heard his voice,
<BR>and I know he lives, and I know he lives.
<BR>Death, where is you sting? Fear, where is your grip?
<BR>Hearts now free to love; lives now free to give.

<P>1. Those who speak the truth, may be bound in chains;
<BR>but there is no chaining the Word of God.

<P>2. If we die with Christ, we shall rise with him;
<BR>if we share his passion, we shall reign with him.

<P>3. No greater love can there be than this;
<BR>to spend one's, life to give life.

<P>4. In our fragile flesh, the dying of the Lord;
<BR>in our faithful living, his life revealed.
