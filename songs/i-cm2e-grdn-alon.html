<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>I come to the garden alone
<BR>While the dew is still on the roses
<BR>And the voice I hear falling on my ear
<BR>The Son of God discloses.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
<BR>And He tells me I am His own;
<BR>And the joy we share as we tarry there,
<BR>None other has ever known.

<P>He speaks, and the sound of His voice,
<BR>Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
<BR>And the melody that He gave to me
<BR>Within my heart is ringing. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>I'd stay in the garden with Him
<BR>Though the night around me be falling,
<BR>But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
<BR>His voice to me is calling. <B>Refrain</B>
