<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ABBA - [1], PO down, FO > NDS, touches forehead and then chin. This is an Israeli sign for Abba (Father) and it has already been fingerspelled. You can explain this sign to your Deaf audience beforehand, ifyou wish.

<P>HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH is held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/heavenlyfather_a.swf">ASL Pro: Heavenly Father - 1.</A>

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P>SPIN-POTTERY-WHEEL - Mime spinning a pottery wheel at chest height by grabbing and releasing it on the edges with a twist.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>
