<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Where charity and love are, God is there.
<BR>Christ's love has gathered us into one.
<BR>Let us rejoice and be pleased in Him.
<BR>Let us fear, and let us love the living God.
<BR>And may we love each other with a sincere heart. 

<P>2. Where charity and love are, God is there.
<BR>As we are gathered into one body,
<BR>Beware, lest we be divided in mind.
<BR>Let evil impulses stop, let controversy cease,
<BR>And may Christ our God be in our midst. 

<P>3. Where charity and love are, God is there.
<BR>And may we with the saints also,
<BR>See Thy face in glory, O Christ our God:
<BR>The joy that is immense and good,
<BR>Unto the ages through infinite ages. Amen.
