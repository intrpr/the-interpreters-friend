<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
<BR>The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
<BR>When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
<BR>Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

<P>2. (some omit) Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
<BR>Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
<BR>Change and decay in all around I see;
<BR>O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

<P>3. (some omit) Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;
<BR>But as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord,
<BR>Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
<BR>Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.

<P>4. (some omit) Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
<BR>But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,
<BR>Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea—
<BR>Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.

<P>5. (some omit) Thou on my head in early youth didst smile;
<BR>And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
<BR>Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee,
<BR>On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

<P>6. I need Thy presence every passing hour.
<BR>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
<BR>Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
<BR>Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

<P>7. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
<BR>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
<BR>Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
<BR>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

<P>8. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
<BR>Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
<BR>Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
<BR>In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
