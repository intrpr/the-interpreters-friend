<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Christ is the world's light,
<BR>Christ and none other;
<BR>born in our darkness,
<BR>He became our brother-
<BR>if we have seen Him,
<BR>we have seen the Father:
<BR>Glory to God on high!

<P>2. Christ is the world's peace,
<BR>Christ and none other;
<BR>no one can serve Him,
<BR>and despise another.
<BR>Who else unites us,
<BR>one in God the Father?
<BR>Glory to God on high!

<P>3. Christ is the world's life,
<BR>Christ and none other;
<BR>sold once for silver,
<BR>murdered here, our brother-
<BR>He, who redeems us,
<BR>reigns with God the Father:
<BR>Glory to God on high!

<P>4. Give God the glory,
<BR>God and none other;
<BR>give God the glory,
<BR>Spirit, Son and Father;
<BR>give God the glory,
<BR>God-with-us our brother:
<BR>Glory to God on high!
