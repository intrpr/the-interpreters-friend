<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> YAHWEH - Y-GOD.

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>ETERNAL - ALWAYS + DH produces STILL in the usual way, and the NDH produces STILL so that it moves back over the shoulder. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/e/eternal.swf">ASL Pro: Eternal.</A>

<P>HEAVEN - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs >&lt;, hands are held high, circle around each other and then separate.

<P>BIRD-FLY - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and hands flap like wings while showing the path of the flight. 

<P>SAIL - DH [B^], PO > signer, FO up, rests on dorsal (back) side of hand which is held as in TABLE. The signer blows into the DH palm and the "ship" moves forward. 

<P>SCULPT - FT of [A dot] digs and twists at palm of [B], PO > DS, FO away. 

<P>AWED - (2h)[S], POs >&lt;, FOs up are held at eyes with awed facial expression and the hands open and then close.

<P>DOT-SKY - (2h)[5:], POs and FOs diagonally up, hands jab upwards as if dotting the sky with stars. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Yahweh, I know you are near, standing always at my side.
You guard me from the foe, and you lead me in ways everlasting.

<P>1. Lord, you have searched my heart, and you know when I sit and when I stand. Your hand is upon me protecting me from death, keeping me from harm.

<P>2. Where can I run from your love? If I climb to the heavens you are there; if I fly to the sunrise or sail beyond the sea, still I'd find you there.

<P>3. You know my heart and its ways, you who formed me before I was born, in the secret of darkness before I saw the sun, in my mother's womb.

<P>4. Marvelous to me are your works; how profound are your thoughts, my Lord. Even if I could count them, they number as the stars, you would still be there.
