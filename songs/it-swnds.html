<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. It sounds along the ages, soul answering to soul; 
<BR>it kindles on the pages of every Bible scroll; 
<BR>the psalmist heard and sang it, from martyr lips it broke, 
<BR>and prophet tongues outrang it till sleeping nations woke.

<P>2. From Sinai's cliffs it echoed, it breathed from Buddha's tree, 
<BR>it charmed in Athens' market, it hallowed Galilee; 
<BR>the hammer stroke of Luther, the Pilgrims' seaside prayer, 
<BR>the oracles of Concord one holy word declare.

<P>3. It calls—and lo, new justice! It speaks and lo, new truth! 
<BR>In ever nobler stature and unexhausted youth. 
<BR>Forever on resounding, and knowing nought of time, 
<BR>our laws but catch the music of its eternal chime.3
