<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>Just one voice singing in the darkness
<BR>All it takes is one voice
<BR>Singing so they hear what's on your mind
<BR>And when you look around you'll find
<BR>There's more than one voice singing in the darkness
<BR>Joining with that one voice
<BR>Each and every note another octave
<BR>Hands are joined and fears unlocked

<P>If only one voice would start it on it's own
<BR>We need just one voice facing the unknown
<BR>And then that one voice would never be alone
<BR>It takes that one voice
<BR>Ba ba ba da da da da...
<BR>It takes that one voice

<P>Just one voice singing in the darkness
<BR>All it takes is one voice
<BR>Shout it out and let it ring
<BR>Just one voice
<BR>It takes that one voice
<BR>And every one will sing
