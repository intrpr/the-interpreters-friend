<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>ALLAH - Point to Heaven and mouth "Allah". This and the sign for Muhammad and prayer are Saudi Arabian signs. Each country in the Arab world may have different signs and if you know that your consumer prefers others, use them. AS a default I use those from Saudi Arabia, since that is where Mecca is.

<P>ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>TESTIFY - NDH [B], PO away, FO up, is held as if swearing and DH [1] executes the sign SAY.

<P>HAVE-NONE - (2h)[B], POs > signer move upwards past mouth and swing upwards and apart while mouth blows on hands as they pass.

<P>MUHAMMAD - [B], PO down, FO > NDS, touches chin and descends. For a film of this Saudi sign, see <A HREF="http://www.menasy.com/02002.htm">Mohammed Messenger of God.</A> (&lt; Muhammad's beard) 

<P>MUSLIM-PRAYER - (2h)[loose 5], palms face each other, FOs up, hands descend and hands overlap each other at the waist.</B> For a film of this Saudi sign, see <A HREF="http://www.menasy.com/02010.htm">Pray / prayer.</A> 

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist.

<P>BEAT - (2h)[S], DPO > NDS, NDPO down, FOs away, are held with DH on top of NDH and DH strikes NDH at wrist while index and middle fingers shoot out suddenly. This portion of the prayer is not shown in the video below.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>Allah is supreme. (4 times)

<P>I testify that there is no god but Allah. (2 times)

<P>I testify that Muhammad is Allah's messenger. (2 times)

<P>Hurry to prayer. (2 times). 

<P>Hurry to success. (2 times)

<P>Allah is supreme. (2 times)

<P>There is no god but Allah.
