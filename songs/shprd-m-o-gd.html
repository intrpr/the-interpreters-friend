<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Shepherd me, O God, beyond my wants, beyond my fears, from death into life.

<P>1. God is my shepherd, so nothing shall I want, I rest in the meadows  of faithfulness and love, I walk by the quiet waters of peace.

<P>2. Gently you raise me and heal my weary soul, you lead me by pathways of righteousness and truth, my spirit shall sing the music of your Name,

<P>3. Though I should wander the valley of death, I fear no evil, for you are at my side, your rod and your staff, my comfort and my hope.

<P>4. You have set my a banquet of love in the face of hatred, crowning me with love beyond my power to hold.

<P>5. Surely your kindness and mercy follow me all the days of my live; I will dwell in the house of my God forevermore.
