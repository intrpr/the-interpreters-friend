<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>We three kings of Orient are;
<BR>Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
<BR>Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
<BR>Following yonder star.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: O star of wonder, star of light,
<BR>Star with royal beauty bright,
<BR>Westward leading, still proceeding,
<BR>Guide us to thy perfect light.

<P>Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
<BR>Gold I bring to crown Him again,
<BR>King forever, ceasing never,
<BR>Over us all to reign. 

<P>Frankincense to offer have I;
<BR>Incense owns a Deity nigh;
<BR>Prayer and praising, voices raising,
<BR>Worshipping God on high. 

<P>Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
<BR>Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
<BR>Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
<BR>Sealed in the stone cold tomb. 

<P>Glorious now behold Him arise;
<BR>King and God and sacrifice;
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia,
<BR>Sounds through the earth and skies.
