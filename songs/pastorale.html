<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Down from the heav'ns on high, from out the starry sky, 
<BR>||: In winter's cold and snow, Thy bed a cave below. :||  
<BR>O sweet child divine and holy, 
<BR>Thee I behold here trembling and lowly, 
<BR>The King and Lord of all! 
<BR>||: Ah priceless love and rare, in stall reclining there! :||

<P>2. No robe to shield from storm, no fire to keep Thee warm. 
<BR>||: Dear little Lord who are by God's will set apart. :|| 
<BR>Thou, Creator, Babe most royal, 
<BR>Poverty, Thy handmaid loyal, 
<BR>E'er flames her heart for Thee! 
<BR>||: For man is love made sure, since Love itself is poor! :||

<P>3. For God's own breast divine, Thou must on hay recline. 
<BR>||: Here linger till Thou know full well life's every woe. :|| 
<BR>O my heart to heaven is soaring, 
<BR>Now my Jesus with transports adoring,
<BR>Who giveth all to me! 
<BR>||: Why must He suffer pain? To win me heavn'ly gain! :||

<P>4. Soft tears Thine eyes now fill, whose love has made Thee will 
<BR>||: To suffer pain and loss, to die upon a Cross. :|| 
<BR>Dear Lord Jesus, how swift the arousal 
<BR>Of my own tears for Thy grief's espousal, 
<BR>Beloved Lord and God! 
<BR>||: For love, not grief nor fear, Thou sheddest every tear. :||

<P>5. As great Thy love and wide, so small doth mine abide; 
<BR>||: Tho' Baby, Thou must weep, in my arms laid to sleep. :|| 
<BR>O if this here were but a bower fragrant, 
<BR>With scent of tree and flower, 
<BR>A sunny cradle for Thee! 
<BR>||: Dear Lamb, weep not so sore, I love Thee ever more! :||

<P>6. Thy baby hands now fold, while dreams Thine eyelids hold. 
<BR>||: My watch shall sleep forefend, while I on Thee attend. :|| 
<BR>O what sorrowful dream is enshrouding 
<BR>Thy infant brow with shadow beclouding. 
<BR>O Lambkin, spotless and pure? 
<BR>||: "For thy sake I must die." I hear an anguished cry. :||

<P>7. Thy life Thou'lt give for me. Can greater love e'er be? 
<BR>||: O Mary Mother fair, to Thee in hope I repair. :|| 
<BR>Hail to Thee O blest Virgin-Mother. 
<BR>Loving Thy Son as can no other,
<BR>O full of grace and Truth! 
<BR>||: Pray God who reigns above, to shed on me His love. :||
