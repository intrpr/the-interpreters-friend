<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,
<BR>But it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand;
<BR>God sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,
<BR>The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> All good gifts around us
<BR>Are sent from heaven above,
<BR>Thank you, Lord, O thank you
<BR>For all your love.
 
<P>2. You only are the Maker of all things near and far;
<BR>You paint the wayside flower, you light the evening star.
<BR>The winds and waves obey you, by you the birds are fed;
<BR>Much more to us, your children, you give our daily bread.

<P>3. We thank you, then, Creator, for all things bright and good,
<BR>The seedtime and the harvest, our life, our health, and food;
<BR>And all that we can offer, your boundless love imparts,
<BR>The gifts to you most pleasing are humble, thankful hearts.
