<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;
<BR>To His feet thy tribute bring.
<BR>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
<BR>Evermore His praises sing:
<BR>Alleluia! Alleluia!
<BR>Praise the everlasting King.

<P>2. Praise Him for His grace and favor
<BR>To our fathers in distress.
<BR>Praise Him still the same as ever,
<BR>Slow to chide, and swift to bless.
<BR>Alleluia! Alleluia!
<BR>Glorious in His faithfulness.

<P>3. Fatherlike He tends and spares us;
<BR>Well our feeble frame He knows.
<BR>In His hands He gently bears us,
<BR>Rescues us from all our foes.
<BR>Alleluia! Alleluia!
<BR>Widely yet His mercy flows.

<P>4. Frail as summer's flower we flourish,
<BR>Blows the wind and it is gone;
<BR>But while mortals rise and perish
<BR>Our God lives unchanging on,
<BR>Praise Him, Praise Him, Hallelujah
<BR>Praise the High Eternal One!

<P>5. Angels, help us to adore Him;
<BR>Ye behold Him face to face;
<BR>Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
<BR>Dwellers all in time and space.
<BR>Alleluia! Alleluia!
<BR>Praise with us the God of grace.
