<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Revive my heart, renew my soul. 
<BR>In you O Lord, I am made whole. 
<BR>No more in fear will I wander, 
<BR>Cause You're my God, my Lord and lover. 
<BR>Like a burning fire, be my one desire. 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I want to be holy just like You, 
<BR>I want to go where you lead me to. 
<BR>With reckless abandon in Your truth, 
<BR>I want to fall deeper in love with You. 

<P>2. Oh lift me up, God and Father. 
<BR>In all this world there is no other. 
<BR>I'm dancing in Your holy presence, 
<BR>And Your glory fills all my senses. 
<BR>Like a burning fire, be my one desire.
