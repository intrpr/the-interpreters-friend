<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Though the mountains may fall and the hills turn to dust, yet the love of the Lord will stand as a shelter for all who will call on his name. Sing the praise and glory of God.

<P>1. Could the Lord ever leave you? Could the Lord forget His love? Though a mother forsake her child, He will not abandon you.

<P>2. Should you turn and forsake Him, He will gently call your name, Should you wander away from Him, He will always take you back.

<P>3. Go to Him when you're weary. He will give you eagle's wings. You will run, never tire, for your God will be your strength.

<P>4. As He swore to your fathers, when the floods destroyed the land, He will never forsake you. He will swear to you again.
