<P>ALL - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A>

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Rain down, rain down,
<BR>rain down your love on your people.
<BR>Rain down, rain down,
<BR>rain down your love, God of life.

<P>1. Faithful and true is the word of our God;
<BR>all of God's works are so worthy of trust.
<BR>God's mercy falls on the just and the right;
<BR>full of God's love is the earth.

<P>2. We who revere and find hope in our God
<BR>live in the kindness and joy of God's wing.
<BR>God will protect us from darkness and death;
<BR>God will not leave us to starve.

<P>3. God of creation, we long for your truth;
<BR>you are the water of life that we thirst.
<BR>Grant that your love and your peace touch our hearts,
<BR>all of our hope lies in you.
