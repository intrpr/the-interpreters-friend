<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I will never forget you, my people; I have carved you on the palm of my hand. I will never forget you; I will not leave you orphaned. I will never forget my own.

<P>2. Does a mother forget her baby? Or a woman the child in her womb? Yet even if these forget, yes, even if these forget, I will never forget my own.
