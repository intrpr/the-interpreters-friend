<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We rise again from ashes, from the good we've failed to do.
<BR>We rise again from ashes, to create ourselves anew.
<BR>If all our world is ashes, then must our lives be true,
<BR>An offering of ashes, an offering to You.

<P>2. We offer You our failures, we offer You attempts;
<BR>The gifts not fully given, the dreams not fully dreamt.
<BR>Give our stumblings direction, give our visions wider view,
<BR>An offering of ashes, an offering to You.

<P>3. Then rise again from ashes, let healing come to pain;
<BR>Though spring has turned to winter, and sunshine turned to rain.
<BR>The rain we'll use for growing, and create the world anew,
<BR>From an offering of ashes, an offering to You.

<P>4. Thanks be to the Father, who made us like Himself.
<BR>Thanks be to His Son, who saved us by His death.
<BR>Thanks be to the Spirit, who creates the world anew,
<BR>From an offering of ashes, an offering to You.
