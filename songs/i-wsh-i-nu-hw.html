<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>BARRIER - (2h)[B], cross at wrists and are held up as a barrier and move forward slightly. 

<P>BARRIER-DOWN - (2h)[B], cross at wrists and are held up as a barrier but the hands are brought down as if the barrier were being removed.

<P>alt.GIFT - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs > the recipents, hands move together from NDS to DS. 

<P>TAKE-ADVANTAGE++ - [5:], PO > signer, FO > NDS, moves down uptruned palm from FT to wrist several times, ending with a slight upward movement as if grabbing up things. 

<P>FLY-AWAY - (2h)[1] cross fingers as in CONFLICT and move up and away while repeatedly curling fingers like flapping wings. 

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I wish I knew how it would feel to be free;
<BR>I wish I could break all the chains holding me.
<BR>I wish I could say all the things that I should say
<BR>Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole round world to hear.

<P>2. I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart,
<BR>Remove all the bars that keep us apart.
<BR>I wish you could know what it means to be me
<BR>Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free.

<P>3. I wish I could give all I'm long - ing to give;
<BR>I wish I could live like I'm longing to live.
<BR>I wish that I could do all the things that I can do
<BR>Though I'm way o - ver - due, I'd be start - ing anew.

<P>4. Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky;
<BR>Oh, I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
<BR>Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, 
<BR>I'd know how it feels, I'd know how it feels to be free,
