<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Where is the passion when you need it the most
<BR>You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
<BR>They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
<BR>They tell me your passion's gone away
<BR>And I don't need no carrying on

<P>Stand in the line just ahead of the law
<BR>You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
<BR>You tell me your life's been way off line
<BR>You're falling to pieces every time
<BR>And I don't need no carrying on

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Cause you had a bad day
<BR>You're taking one down
<BR>You sing a sad song 
<BR>Just to turn it around
<BR>You say you don't know
<BR>You tell me don't lie
<BR>You work at a smile 
<BR>And you go for a ride
<BR>You had a bad day
<BR>The camera don't lie
<BR>You're coming back down 
<BR>And you really don't mind
<BR>You had a bad day 

<P>Well you need a blue sky holiday
<BR>The point is they laugh at what you say
<BR>And I don't need no carrying on

<P><B>Refrain</B>

<P>Sometimes the system goes on the blink
<BR>And the whole thing it turns out wrong
<BR>You might not make it back and you know
<BR>That you could be well oh that strong
<BR>Well I'm not wrong

<P>So where is the passion when you need it the most 
<BR>Oh you and I
<BR>You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

<P><B>Refrain</B>
