<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>As part of the <I>Vidui ashamnu</I> (Collective confession), the worshipers recite together a list of sins that go from alef ("A") to tav ("Z"): <I>ashamnu, begadnu, gazalnu. . .</I>,  I translated this into an ABC story as follows: 

<P>WE SIN A-TO-Z. HELP-lf?  TURN-DOWN-lf.  (>) BAD, DO-UP-rt.  (&lt;) #DO-DO EMERGENCY, NOTHING-TO-IT.  (>) GOSSIP, GOTCHA.  (&lt;) EGOTISM.  (>) JEALOUS-of-lf, CARELESS.  LATER, MURDER-lf.  (&lt;) HONOR-lf? (shake head)  OPPRESS-lf PEOPLE@lf  GUILTY.  (>) RESPECT-G-d?  (shake head)  REBEL-AGAINST-G-d.  (&lt;) TRY ONE-UPSMANSHIP.  (>) LOOK-AROUND WORLD, TEMPTED (2h)alt.ERR. LIGHTNING FINISHwg.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> A-TO-Z - NDH [5], PO > signer, FO up, DH [A] is places on the NDS of the NDH and DH moves > DS while it changes to a [1] and traces out a "Z".

<P>TURN-DOWN-lf - [A], PO > NDS, FO away, thumb is turned down.

<P>DO-UP-rt - (2h)[C], move in small rising circles parallel to the chest, rising as they come together. 

<P>NOTHING-TO-IT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, hands move slightly and symetrically from side to side.

<P>GOTCHA - [U],touches Ft to lips then pronates FT to PO away and strikes at the air in front of the face.

<P>EGOTISM - (2h)[I], alternate strike the thumbside on the chest.

<P>ONE-UPSMANSHIP - (2h)[U], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands alt. strike at each other while both hands rise.

<P>(2h)alt.ERR - hands alt. produce the sign MAKE-MISTAKE.

<P>FINISHwg - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, rise while twising hands rapidly at wrists.
