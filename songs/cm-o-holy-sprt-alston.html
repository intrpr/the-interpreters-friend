<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, O Holy Spirit, come! 
<BR>And from your celestial home
<BR>Shed a ray of light divine!
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
<BR>Come, O Father of the poor!
<BR>Come, O Source of all our store! 
<BR>Come, within our bosoms shine!
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!

<P>2. You, of comforters the best;
<BR>You, the soul's most welcome guest;
<BR>Sweet refreshment here below;
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
<BR>In our labor, rest most sweet;
<BR>Grateful coolness in the heat;
<BR>Solace in the midst of woe.
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!

<P>3. O most blessed Light divine,
<BR>May that Light within us shine,
<BR>And ouR inmost being fill!
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
<BR>In your absence, we have naught, 
<BR>Nothing good in deed or thought,
<BR>Nothing free from taint of ill.
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!

<P>4. Heal our wounds, our strength renew;
<BR>On our dryness pour your dew;
<BR>Wash the stains of guilt away:
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
<BR>Bend the stubborn heart and will;
<BR>Melt the frozen, warm the chill;
<BR>Guide the steps that go astray.
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!

<P>5. On the faithful who adore
<BR>And confess you ever more,
<BR>In  your sevenfold gift descend;
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
<BR>Give them virtue's sure reward;
<BR>Give them your salvation, Lord;
<BR>Give them joys that never end,
<BR>Come, O Holy Spirit, come!
