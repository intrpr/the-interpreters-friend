<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I am standing waiting, waiting at your door.
<BR>One of hunger’s children from a billion poor.
<BR>Through you cannot see me, though I am so small
<BR>Listen to my crying, crying for us all.

<P>2. I stand at your table, asking to be fed
<BR>Holding up my rice bowl, begging for your bread,
<BR>I stand at your school-room, longing just to learn,
<BR>Hoping that you’ll teach me ways to live and earn.

<P>3. I stand at your clinic begging for vaccine,
<BR>I stand at your wash place where the water’s clean,
<BR>I stand at your office, beg the Head’s of State,
<BR>I am just a child, so I must hope and wait.

<P>4. I stand at your churches, listen to your prayers,
<BR>Long to know a God who understands and cares.
<BR>If there is a God, God who loves the poor,
<BR>I’m still standing waiting, waiting at your door.
