<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>DEEPLY-INVOLVED - [V:], PO > signer, FO up, strikes palm of slightly curved [B], Po > DS, FO away. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.  

<P>DISCIPLE - D-FOLLOW AGENT.

<P>SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>LEAD-TO - Same sign as LEAD but I add the "-TO" to show the function of the sign in thIS sentence. 

<P>alt.GIFT-TO"each" - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs > the recipents, hands move together from NDS to DS. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>WASH-FEET - (2h)[1^] point to feet + (2h)[A], POs down, FOs away, move in symmetrical circles as if washing feet. 

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process. 

<P>KINGDOM - KING + [5], PO down, FO away, circles horizontally. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_kingdom.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Kingdom.</A>  

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>CALVARY - MOUNTAIN + POSITIVE held high as if it were a cross on top of the mountain just indicated. 

<P>NARROW - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are brought together with <U>hu</U>. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, be my light, be my voice to the nations. Be my hands, be my heart for the world. Would you go where I go? Where I lead, will you follow? Would you leave everything for my sake? By the power of the Spirit, everyone with ears to hear it will embrace the call to love within their heart.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> If anyone would come and follow me, my disciple you would be. Leave the past behind, seek and you will find all you're called to be. If anyone would come and follow me, know the truth will make you free. Give and you receive. Trust me and believe. Come and follow me. (After final verse, repeat last three sentences twice.)

<P>2. Go, take your gift to the poor and the lonely. As you love, so will I live in you. Will you feed, feed my lambs? Share your hope with the hopeless? Bring new sight to the blind in my name? With a towel and a basin, toward the kingdom we will haste, through the narrow gate the leads to Calvary.
