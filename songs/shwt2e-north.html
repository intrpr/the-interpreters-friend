<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>FAITH - Like THINK TRUST but with elevated hands to show the trust is spiritual. 

<P>ARISE - (2h[B], POs up, FOs away, ascend from below to gesture people to stand up.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>CONFESS - (2h)[B], POs > chest, FOs down, touch torso, run FTs up it, then turn FTs away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/a/admit.swf">ASL Pro: Admit.</A>  

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P>AWESOME - (2h)[S], POs >&lt;, FOs up are held at eyes with awed facial expression and the hands open and then close. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P>SEALED - Stamp uptunred NDH palm with [S], PO > NDS, FO away. 

<P>WINGS - Second half of ANGEL: arms extended and bent move slightly as if flying gently. 

<P>(2h)THIS - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands descend slightly. 

<P>LONG-LIST - (2h)[O^], POs > signer, NDH - above and touches DH; both hands open to (2h)[5] while DH descends.

<P>FAR-AWAY - [1], twists while moving away with tongue shuttling from side to side. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/f/far.swf">ASL Pro: Far.</A> 

<P>FLY-AWAY - (2h)[1] cross fingers as in CONFLICT and move up and away while repeatedly curling fingers like flapping wings. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Men of faith rise up and sing
<BR>Of the great and glorious King
<BR>You are strong when you feel weak
<BR>In your brokeness complete

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Shout to the North and the South
<BR>Sing to the East and the West
<BR>Jesus is saviour to all
<BR>Lord of heaven and earth

<P>2. Rise up women of the truth
<BR>Stand and sing to broken hearts
<BR>Who can know the healing power
<BR>Of our awesome King of love

<P>3. We've been through fire we've been
through rain
<BR>We've been refined by the power of his name
<BR>We've fallen deeper in love with you
<BR>You've burned the truth on our lips

<P>4. Rise up church with broken wings
<BR>Fill this place with songs again
<BR>Of our God who reigns on high
<BR>By His grace again we'll fly
