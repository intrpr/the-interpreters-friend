<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> JESUS MY LORD FINISH SAVE <U>ME</U> does not include the concept of "wonderful" because the song is in 3/4 time and has three beats per measure.  I translated it so the JESUS, LORD, and SAVE could be the three emphasized beats.  "wonderful" does appear in the next translated line.

<P><U>ME</U> - The honorific index where the fingertips of [B^], PO points towards the back of the signer, run down the side of the chest.

<P>B-CL'cleft' - Imagine a flat indented place in a mountain and sweep the hand so that it describes the back wall of that indentation.

<P>FLOW-BY - (2h)[4], DHPO down, NDHPO up, FOs away, both hands move towards right side. 

<P>REALLY-INTO - DH [V:], PO > signer, FO up, is held high, circles horizontally, then descends rapidly into the center of [C], PO > DS, FO away.

<P>COVER - DH [B], PO down, FO away, brushes over NDH, [B], PO down, FO > DS, from FT to wrist.

<P>BURDEN - The same sign as FAULT.

<P>(2h)C-CL'lift burden off shoulder' - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder as if hodling a burden, then move together to lift the burden off.

<P>SCOOP-UP~LIFT - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature.

<P>UPRIGHT - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly in the palm of NDH [B]. Similar to the sign SET-A-RECORD, but the NDPO is up.

<P>EVERYDAY STRONG, <U>HE</U> TEACH-me - I have used TEACH rather than GIVE or GIFT-TO, since one can teach strength, but can't really give it. 

<P>LONG-LIST - (2h)[O^], POs > signer, NDH is above and touches DH; both hands open to (2h)[5] while DH descends.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>PUT-CROWN-ON - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) place crown on head with large single movement. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/c/crown.swf">ASL Pro: Crown.</A> 

<P>PRESENCE - TOGETHER with a small movement away and towards.

<P>GOD'S - GOD + palm of [B] is pointed where God is spatialized.

<P>God-HELP-me - The sign HELP is moved from high at DS towards the signer's chest. 

<P>ASCEND - DH [V] stands on NDH B, PO up and DH ascends.

<P>body-SHINY+ - (2h)[open 8], POs > signer, alt. move away from chest while twisting slight at wrists. 

<P>COMPLETE - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A>

<P>MILLIONS - FT of [B^] repeatedly taps palm of NDH [B], PO up, FO away, as both hands move away from body. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
<BR>A wonderful Savior to me;
<BR>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
<BR>Where rivers of pleasure I see.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
<BR>That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
<BR>He hideth my life with the depths of His love,
<BR>And covers me there with His hand,
<BR>And covers me there with His hand.

<P>2. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
<BR>He taketh my burden away;
<BR>He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
<BR>He giveth me strength as my day. 

<P>3. With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
<BR>And filled with His fullness divine,
<BR>I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
<BR>For such a Redeemer as mine! 

<P>4. When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
<BR>To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
<BR>His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
<BR>I'll shout with the millions on high.
