<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Out of the depths I cry to you, I cry to you, O Lord. Lord, open your ears and hear my voice, attend to the sound of my plea.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> With the Lord there is mercy and the fullness of redemption, call to him in your trials, he will answer whenever you call.

<P>2. If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt, then, Lord, who could hope to survive? But with you is found forgiveness of sin, and mercy that we might revere you.

<P>3. Trust in the Lord, count on his word, wait for the Lord, my soul. I will wait for the Lord all the days of my life as sentinels wait for the dawn.

<P>4. More than sentinels wait for the dawn, let Israel wait for the Lord. For kindness is His, redemption for all, forgiveness of sins for his people.
