<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>SCULPT - [A dot], PO down, FO away, descends next to [B], PO > DS, FO away, in a wavey pattern as if sculpting something on palm.

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A> 

<P>PILLAR - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, ascend, showing the boundaries of the Pillar of Fire that led the Israelites in the Wilderness.

<P>ON-AND-ON - CONTINUE is signed in a vertical circle normal (perpendicular) to the chest.

<P>REVOLVE-IN-SKY - (2h)[5:], POs up, FOs > back of signer, hands are held high and the hands shown how the starts reolve in the sky. 

<P>LAKE - WATER + (2h)bC-CL show the boundaris of a lake.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>WORSHIP - NDH is clasped over DH [S] and hands circle perpendicular to the chest.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=55">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Worship.</A> 

<P>UNITED - COOPERATE.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>HOSANNA -  Clap the hands once, then bring (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, down almost to the knees and make them circle up repeatedly in a plane normal (perpendicular) to the chest until they rise up to the level of the head. If you are interested in the word, itself, read on. From the Hebrew "Hoshia na (Save us, please)", but because of the scene of the Triumphal Entry (of Jesus into Jerusalem before the Crucifixion) where the crowd calls this out to him, this has been traditionally used as an exclamation of joy. I use an alteration of the sign for "Hallelujah/Alleluia!" 

<P>ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>
 
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving
<BR>To God the creator triumphantly raise.
<BR>Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,
<BR>Who still guides us on to the end of our days.
<BR>God's banners are o'er us, His light goes before us,
<BR>A pillar of fire shining forth in the night.
<BR>Till shadows have vanished and darkness is banished
<BR>As forward we travel from light into light.

<P>2. His law he enforces, the stars in their courses
<BR>And sun in its orbit obediently shine;
<BR>The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,
<BR>The deeps of the ocean proclaim him divine.
<BR>We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing;
<BR>With glad adoration a Song let us raise
<BR>Till all things now living unite in thanksgiving:
<BR>"To God in the highest, Hosanna and praise!"
