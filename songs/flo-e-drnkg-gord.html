FOLLOW THE DRINKING GOURD: A Slave's map to freedom
 
Drinking gourd- Big Dipper....can be spotted at dusk and visible all night (esp after the moon rises)
 
CARRY YOU TO FREEDOM- carry you is country for be your guide...I giggle cause my grandmother uses "CARRY YOU/ME"
 
OLD MAN- Underground Railroad contact
 
SUN COMES BACK...FIRST QUAIL...- you are correct in that it's sunrise, but the quail isnt a bird. Its the whistle (quail hunting) used by the contact to communicate with the slave without causing attention to themselves.
 
RIVERBANK MAKES A GOOD ROAD- they were told to stay close to the water because it threw off the scent of the dogs...
 
DEAD TREES- green moss grows on the north side of the tree--no sunlight...came in handy on nights when the sky wasn't clear...or traveling from a clear to a cloudy area..
 
LEFT FOOT PEG FOOT-- another way NOT to draw attention to yourself...if you were seen it appears you're on your way back from the fields
 
RIVER BETWEEN TWO HILLS...RIVER ON THE OTHER SIDE....landmarks to let you know where you are..once they made it to the two rivers they were most often home free....-->
