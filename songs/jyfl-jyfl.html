<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love. 
<BR>Hearts unfold like flowers before thee, opening to the sun above. 
<BR>Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away. 
<BR>Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.

<P>2. All thy works with joy surround thee; earth and heaven reflect thy rays. <BR>Stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise. 
<BR>Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea, 
<BR>chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee.

<P>3. Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blest. 
<BR>Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest! 
<BR>Thou our Father, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thine. 
<BR>Teach us how to love each other. Lift us to the joy divine.

<P>4. Mortals, join the mighty chorus, which the morning stars began. 
<BR>Love divine is reigning o'er us, binding all within its span. 
<BR>Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife. 
<BR>Joyful music leads us sunward, in the triumph song of life.
