<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When the night has come,
<BR>And the land is dark,
<BR>And the moon is the only light we see,
<BR>No, I won't be afraid.
<BR>Oh, I won't be afraid.
<BR>Just as long as you stand,
<BR>Stand by me, so

<P>||: Darling darling stand by me.
<BR>Oh, stand by me.
<BR>Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me.
<BR>If the sky that we look upon
<BR>Should tumble and fall,
<BR>Or the mountain
<BR>Should crumble to the sea,
<BR>I won't cry, I won't cry.
<BR>No, I won't shed a tear,
<BR>Just as long as you stand,
<BR>Stand by me, and :||

<P>Whenever you're in trouble,
<BR>Won't you stand by me, oh stand by me.
