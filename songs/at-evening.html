<P>1. Now it is evening: Lights of the city

<BR>Many are lonely, Who will be neighbor?
<BR>Where there is caring Christ is our Light.

<BR>Bid us remember Christ is our Peace.
<BR>Some are neglected, Who will be neighbor?
<BR>Where there is caring Christ is our Peace.

<P>3. Now it is evening: Food on the table
<BR>Bid us remember Christ is our Life.
<BR>Many are hungry, Who will be neighbor?
<BR>Where there is sharing Christ is our Life.

<P>4. Now it is evening: Here in our meeting
<BR>May us remember Christ is our Friend.
<BR>Some may be strangers, Who will be neighbor?
<BR>Where there's a welcome Christ is our Friend.
