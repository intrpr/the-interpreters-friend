<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. The first Noel the angel did say
<BR>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
<BR>In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
<BR>On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
<BR>Born is the King of Israel.

<P>2. They looked up and saw a star
<BR>Shining in the east, beyond them far;
<BR>And to the earth it gave great light,
<BR>And so it continued both day and night. 

<P>3. And by the light of that same star
<BR>Three Wise Men came from country far;
<BR>To seek for a King was their intent,
<BR>And to follow the star wherever it went. 

<P>4. This star drew nigh to the northwest,
<BR>Over Bethlehem it took its rest;
<BR>And there it did both stop and stay,
<BR>Right over the place where Jesus lay.

<P>5. Then did they know assuredly
<BR>Within that house the King did lie;
<BR>One entered it them for to see,
<BR>And found the Babe in poverty. 

<P>6. Then entered in those Wise Men three,
<BR>Full reverently upon the knee,
<BR>And offered there, in His presence,
<BR>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 

<P>7. Between an ox stall and an ass,
<BR>This Child truly there He was;
<BR>For want of clothing they did Him lay
<BR>All in a manger, among the hay. 

<P>8. Then let us all with one accord
<BR>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
<BR>That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
<BR>And with His blood mankind hath bought. 

<P>9. If we in our time shall do well,
<BR>We shall be free from death and hell;
<BR>For God hath prepared for us all
<BR>A resting place in general.
