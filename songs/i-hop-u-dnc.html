<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U> - All underlined glosses are honorific indices ("indexes"). 

<P>"WOW" - [5] shake out hand, swiveling at elbow.

<P>DON'T - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>SAME-OLD-THING - (2h)[Y], POs down, FOs away, circle vertically and symmetrically in a plane parallel to the chest.

<P>NOTHING-TO-IT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, hands move slightly and symetrically from side to side. 

<P>"PSHAW" - the hearing gesture where [B], PO away, FO up, moves away slightly and nods once at wrist as if to say, "Forget about it."

<P>FROM-NOW-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DHFT touches knuckle side of NDHFT and moves away in a downward arc. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1382.htm">ASL browser - from now on</A>.

<P>ARROGANT - (2h)[L:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, are held at forehead and suddenly expand. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/B/W0468.htm">ASL browser - brat</A>.

<P>CLOSE-DOOR-IN-FACE - CLOSE is signed close to the face.

<P>BE-WALLFLOWER - [K], FOs down, is pushed against [B], PO > signer, FO > DS as if someone is standing right up against the wall, afraid to dance.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>WORTH-IT - Like the sign IMPORTANT, but the signer mouths "worth it".

<P>BY-A-HAIR - [F] pulls a hair from the head while wincing.

<P>VALUES - Same as the sign CHERISH, but with a double movement.

<P>STRIATED - (2h)[4], POs away, FOs up, descend in a wavy pattern.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.   

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
<BR>You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
<BR>May you never take one single breath for granted
<BR>God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

<P>2. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
<BR>Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
<BR>Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
<BR>And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
<BR>I hope you dance . . .

<P>3. I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
<BR>Never settle for the path of least resistance
<BR>Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking
<BR>Loving might be a mistake but it's worth making

<P>4. Don't let some helping heart leave you bitter
<BR>When you come close to selling out reconsider
<BR>Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
<BR>And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
<BR>I hope you dance . . .

<P>5. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
<BR>Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
<BR>Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
<BR>And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
<BR>Dance, I hope you dance
<BR>I hope you dance . . .
