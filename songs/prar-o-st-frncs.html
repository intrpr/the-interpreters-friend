<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Make me a channel of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me bring your love. Where there is injury, your Pardon, Lord, and where there's doubt, true faith in you.

<P>2. Make me a channel of your peace. Where ther's despair in life, let me bring hope. Where there is darkness, only light, and where there's sadness ever joy.

<P>3. O Master, grant that I may never seek so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved, as to love, with all my soul.

<P>4. Make me a channel of your peace. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. In giving of ourselves that we receive,  and in dying that we're born to eternal life.
