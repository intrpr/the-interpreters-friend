<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> My soul is thirsting, my body pines; 
<BR>for you my heart is longing. 
<BR>Your love is better than life itself; 
<BR>you are the God who upholds me.
<BR>You are the God whom I seek.

<P>1. Like a dry weary land without water, 
<BR>so my flesh pines for you; 
<BR>parched and lifeless is my spirit without you.

<P>2. I will bless you as long as I live; 
<BR>I will sing songs of praise. 
<BR>In your presence I will feast aNd be filled.

<P>3. In the watches of night I remember; 
<BR>you, my God, you, my help. 
<BR>In the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
