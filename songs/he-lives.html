Ê<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I serve a risen Savior, He's in the world today;
<BR>I know that He is living, whatever men may say;
<BR>I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,
<BR>And just the time I need Him He's always near. 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
<BR>He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
<BR>He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
<BR>You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.

<P>2. In all the world around me I see His loving care,
<BR>And tho' my heart grows weary, I never will despair.
<BR>I know that He is leading thro' all the stormy blase;
<BR>The day of His appearing will come at last. 

<P>3. Rejoice, rejoice, O Christians, lift up your voice and sing
<BR>Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!
<BR>The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find,
<BR>None other is so loving, so good and kind.
