<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Where charity and love prevail, there God is ever found; Brought here together by Christ's love, by love are we thus bound.

<P>2. With grateful joy and holy fear God's charity we learn; Let us with heart and mind and soul now love God in return.

<P>3. Forgive we now each other's faults as we our faults confess; And let us love each other well in Christian holiness.

<P>4. Let strife among us be unknown, let all contention cease; Be God's the glory that we seek, be ours God's holy peace.

<P>5. Let us recall that in our midst dwells God's begotten Son; As members of his body joined, we are in Christ made one.

<P>6. No race or creed can love exclude, if honored be God's name; Our family embraces all whose Father is the same.
