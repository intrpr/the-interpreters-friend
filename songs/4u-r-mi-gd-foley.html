<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> For you are my God; you alone are my joy. Defend me, O Lord.

<P>1. You give marvelous comrades to me:
<BR>the faithful who dwell in Your land.
<BR>Those who choose alien gods
<BR>have chosen an alien band. 

<P>2. You are my portion and cup;
<BR>It is You that I claim for my prize.
<BR>Your heritage is my delight, 
<BR>the lot you have given to me.
      
<P>3. Glad are my heart and my soul
<BR>Securely my body will rest
<BR>For you will not leave me for dead
<BR>Nor lead your beloved astray

<P>4. You show me the path for my life
<BR>In your presence the fullness of joy
<BR>To be at your right hand forever
<BR>For me would be happiness always
