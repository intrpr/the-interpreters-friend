<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> There are a lot of internal rhymes I am trying to parallel in my translation.  Maybe the result is just foolishness.  You could work to improve it or just abandon it.  Hopefully it is at least a noble attempt. 

<P>FAVOR - [open 8] taps middle FT against chin, like PREFER. 

<P>TRAVEL'spiralling' - [V:], PO down, FO away, travels slowly in a spiral from NDS to DS.

<P>BIG-QUESTION - Like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that is a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.

<P>TAKE-OPPORTUNITY++ - [C], PO > NDS, FO away, brushes down of [B], PO up, FO away, and then closes to [S] and DH ascends.  This is done repeatedly.

<P>ADVANCED++ - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards repeatedly arcing towards the signer. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/a/advance.swf">ASL Pro - advance</A>.

<P>STEP-BY-STEP - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DH is held ahead of NDH, then NDH leapfrogs over DH, and DH over NDH.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/P/W3047.htm">ASL browser - procedure</A>.

<P>(2h)alt.OVERLOOK - (2h)[B], POs > signer alternately pass by the face at a diagonal.

<P>RAISE - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if raising up a person.

<P>PUSH-me-DOWN, HIS GRACE PUSH-me-UP - DH [B], PO down, FO away, pushes down on thumb of [A dot], PO > DS, FO away.  The NDH is held in place while the DH signs HIS GRACE, then the DH supinates and comes under the [A dot] to push it up like the sign HELP.

<P>DIE"step by step" - DIE is produced in slow increments to show the process rather than the result of being dead.

<P>SPEAK-OUT - [4], PO > NDS, FO up, moves once away from the mouth with a deliberate movement. 

<P>THERE-Heaven - [B], PO up, FO is up and then the arm straightens out a bit to point to Heaven.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> <P>I'll tell of the Savior, I'll tell of his favor,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>I count ev'ry blessing, I go on confessing,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>Tho life is uncertain, I cannot understand
<BR>But thank Him and trust Him and praise while I can,
<BR>I'll just tell it, excel it, let all voices swell it,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.

<P>I know Him, adore Him, A good life to show Him,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>He's nearest, He's clearest in my life He's dearest,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>What He is to you maybe you can't see
<BR>But this thing I know, He's everything to me,
<BR>'cause He saved me, He'll raise, for ever I'll praise Him,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.

<P>If satan oppress me, His grace will caress me
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>When troubles depress me, He won't fail to bless me,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
<BR>If I was dying with just one word to say,
<BR>I'd speak it for Jesus then breath my life away,
<BR>'cause He'll be there, Meet me there
<BR>then go where He prepared,
<BR>I'll tell it wherever I go.
