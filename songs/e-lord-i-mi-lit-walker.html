<P>1. The Lord is my light, my help, my salvation. Why should I fear? With God I fear no one. God protects me all my life. With the Lord what should I dread?

<P><B>Refrain:</B> The Lord is my light, THe Lord is my help. The Lord is my salvation.

<P>2. There is one thing I ask of the Lord that I long for: all my days with Gid to be dwelling, gazing with awe at the beauty of God and in wonder look on God's house.

<P>3. I know I will live to see the Lord's goodness; now, in this life, I'm sure I will see it. Trust in the Lord, be strong and be brave; wait in hope for God, our salvation.
