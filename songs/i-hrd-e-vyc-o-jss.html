<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and rest;
<BR>Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon my breast.
<BR>I came to Jesus, as I was, so weary, worn and sad;
<BR>I found in him a resting place, and he has made me glad.

<P>2. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold, I freely give 
<BR>The living water; thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live."
<BR>I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream;
<BR>My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him.

<P>3. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "I am this dark world's light;
<BR>Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, and all thy day be bright." 
<BR>I looked to Jesus, and I found in him my star, my sun;
<BR>And in that light of life I'll walk till trav'ling days are done.
