<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel. :||

<P>1. A vine from Egypt you transplanted;
<BR>you drove away the nations and planted it.
<BR>It put forth its foliage to the Sea.
<BR>its shoots as far as the River.

<P>2. Why have you broken down its walls,
<BR>so that every passer-by plucks its fruit,
<BR>the boar from the forest lays it waste,
<BR>and the beast of the field feed upon it?

<P>3. Once again, O Lord of hosts,
<BR>look down from heaven, and see;
<BR>take care of this vine,
<BR>and protect what your right hand has planted,
<BR>the son of man whom you yourself made strong.

<P>4. Then we will no more withdraw from you;
<BR>give us new life,
<BR>and we will call upon your name.
<BR>O Lord, God of hosts, restore us;
<BR>if your face shine upon us,
<BR>then we shall be saved.
