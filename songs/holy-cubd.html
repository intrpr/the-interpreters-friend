<P>1. Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
<BR>Early in the morning our song will rise to thee:
<BR>Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
<BR>God in three Persons, blesssed Trinity.

<P>2. Holy, Holy, Holy! All the saints adore thee,
<BR>Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
<BR>Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
<BR>Who was, and is, and evermore shall be.

<P>3. Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,
<BR>Though the eyes made blind by sin thy glory may not see,
<BR>Only thou are holy; there is none bedside thee,
<BR>Perfect in power, in love, and purity

<P>4. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
<BR>All thy works shall praise thy Name, in earth and sky and sea; 
<BR>Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
<BR>God in three Persons, blesssed Trinity.
