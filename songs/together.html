<P>||: (3 times) UNITED, #ALL-OF-US UNITED. TWO WORLD (2h)5:-CL'one@lf, one@rt', NO MORE. NEVER AGAIN IGNORE-me. UNITED, BUT INDEPENDENT. WE CONTINUE BRAVE. UNITED, #ALL-OF-US IDEA~LIKE BROTHER+, SISTER+, EQUAL'circle'. WE GO-AHEAD LIVE. OUR HOPE NEVER SOLVE. :|| UNITED. UNITED. 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> UNITED - (2h)[F] interlink thumbs and index fingers and move in a horizontal circle.

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder.  

<P>(2h)5:-CL'one@lf, one@rt' - (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, are firmly placed, one at each side.

<P>IGNORE-me - IGNORE but the sign ends on the signer's chest.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>EQUAL'circle' - EQUAL multiple times circling horizontally.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.
