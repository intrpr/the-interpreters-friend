<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O Lord of Light, shine in my heart. Chase away all darkness from my life, and bring the dawn of knowledge to my world, and I will try to do my part, to light my candle for the world to see, to see Your Light alive in one another.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Come, O Lord! Come to every heart and waken all who sleep to Your joy; O Emmanuel, come to my heart. I still look for the joy Your Christmas brings, and I would be your Presence in the world.

<P>2. O Root of Life, grow in my heart, that I might be a branch upon Your vine, and grow in love as You will grow in me, and I will try to do my part, to plant the seeds of love upon the earth, and bring the fruits of love to one another.

<P>3. O Key of Joy, unlock my heart, break away the chains that hold me close, that keep my love from flowing to the world, and I will try to do my part, to open all the doors that I have closed, the doors that keep us far from one another.

<P>4. O King of Peace, reign in my heart, and join the ends of all the earth as one, that I might join and sing in one great song; and I will try to do my part, reach out to those around me every day, that I might bring your peace to one another.
