<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Gott will ich lassen raten,
<BR>Der alle Ding vermag.
<BR>Er segne meine Taten,
<BR>mein Vornehmen und Sach.
<BR>Denn ich ihm heimgestellt
<BR>mein Leib, mein Seel, mein Leben,
<BR>und was er mir sonst geben;
<BR>er mach's, wie's ihm gefällt.

<P>Darauf so sprech' ich Amen
<BR>und zweifle nicht daran:
<BR>Gott wird uns all' zusammen
<BR>ihm wollgefallen lan.
<BR>Drauf streck' ich aus mein Hand,
<BR>greif an das Werk mit Freuden,
<BR>dazu mich Gott bescheiden
<BR>in meinem Beruf und Stand.

<P><B>English translation: </B>

<P>I want God to counsel me, 
<BR>because he can do everything. 
<BR>He blesses my undertaking, 
<BR>my plans, and my supply, 
<BR>because I offer to him 
<BR>my body, my soul, my life, 
<BR>and everything else I was given. 
<BR>This he does, and it pleases him to do so. 

<P>On this, so say I "Amen," 
<BR>and I have no doubt. 
<BR>Together, God wants us all 
<BR>to please him. 
<BR>On this, I reach out my hand 
<BR>to meet with joy the challenge 
<BR>that God wants me to do 
<BR>for my life calling and purpose.
