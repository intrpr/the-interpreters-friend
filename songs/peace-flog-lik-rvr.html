<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>1, 5. PEACE FLOW-forward IDEA~LIKE RIVER'expand' FROM (2h)<U>YOU</U> AND FROM <U>ME</U>. SPREAD, ENTER DESERT. MEAN OPPRESSED NOW FREE.

<P>2. Replace first sign with L-O-V-E.

<P>3. Replace first sign with HEAL+.

<P>4. ||: (8x) ALLELUIA. :||

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> FLOW-forward - (2h)[4], POs down, FOs >&lt;, NDH is held closer to body, both hands swivel forward 2x. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>RIVER'expand' - What I mean is you can make the ripples of the river a little more poetic to fill the time.

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>OPPRESSED - DH [B], PO down, FO > NDS, pushs down on [S], PO > DS, FO away, which is held against chest.

<P>ALLELUIA! - CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1, 5. Peace is flowing like a river, flowing out of you and me. Flowing out into the desert, setting all the captives free.

<P>2. Love is flowing like a river, flowing out of you and me. Flowing out into the desert, setting all the captives free.

<P>3. Healing's flowing like a river, flowing out of you and me. Flowing out into the desert, setting all the captives free.

<P>4. ||: (8x) Alleluia. :||
