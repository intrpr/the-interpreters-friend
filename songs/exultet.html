<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Rejoice heavenly powers! Sing choirs of angels. Exult creation around God's throne. Jesus Christ, our King, is risen! Sound the trumpet of salvation! Rejoice, O earth, in shining splendor, radiant in the brightness of your King! Christ has conquered! Glory fills you! Darkness vanishes forever! Rejoice, O Mother Church! Exult in glory! The risen Savior shines upon you! Let this place resound with joy, echoing the mighty song of all God's people!

<P>It is truly right that with full hearts and minds and voice we should praise the unseen God, the all-powerful Father, and his only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. For Christ has ransomed us with his blood, and paid for us the price of Adam's sin to our eternal Father! This is our Passover feast, when Christ, the true Lamb, is slain, whose blood consecrates the homes of all believers. This is the night when first you saved our Fathers (some substitute: ancestors). you freed the people of Israel from their slavery and led them dry shod through the sea. 

<P>This is the night when Christians everywhere, washed clean of sin and free from all defilement, are restored to grace and grow together in holiness. This is the night when Jesus Christ broke the chains of death and rose triumphant from the grave. Father, how wonderful your care for us! How boundless your merciful love! To ransom a slave you gave away your Son. O happy fault, O necessary sin of Adam, which gained for us so great a Redeemer! [The power of this night dispels all evil, washes guilt away, restores lost innocence and brings mourners joy.] 

<P>Night truly blessed when heaven is wedded to earth and man is (some substitute: all are) reconciled with God! Therefore, heavenly Father, in the joy of this night receive our evening sacrifice of praise, your Church's solemn offering.
