<P><A NAME="Introduction"><B>Introduction to this translation</B></CENTER>

<P>This is a translation into ASL of the Catholic Mass. To understand the glossing system used, go to the <a href="glws.html">Glossing system used for songs and ritual texts.</A> The following symbology is used to show who is speaking: <B>P</B> = priest, <B>L</B> = lector, <B>C</B> = congregation, <B>A</B> = all, and <B>N</B> = replace with the appropriate name. Each section is glossed independently and notes are offered so that the ASL translation can be compared with the English translation used in American Catholic churches. If you are interpreting for a Deaf person who is not familiar with the Catholic mass, you could sign YOUR-TURN when it is the congregation's turn to say something so that the Deaf consumer(s) can know that it is their turn to sign. It is, of course, their decision if they want to copy the interpreter's sign, sign it in the way they wish, or remain silent. 

<P>My choice is to spatialize Jesus on the left (since he is at the right hand of God and therefore on the left from our perspective), to put God the Father on the right, and the Holy Spirit in the middle. When God as a whole is meant, I spatialize Him in the middle. The notes on signs are cummulative, that is, if a sign is described in an earlier section, it is not described later. Try a search of the page if you don't find a description of the sign you need.

<P>Ideally, the priest, the choir director, and other relevant church workers should share texts with you that will be use for the service. You should be able to get the hymns and the music the choir and soloists will perform a week or so before the service. Some people who are responsible for the music are strangely territorial and may give you trouble, sadly. Explain to them as musical performers that there is a need to try and make the signed hymns look rhythmic and clarify any old-fashioned English and complex concepts as much as possible. If they cannot relate to this, go over their heads. The prayers of the faithful are usually printed out for the lector and should be available the same day. Ask if a second copy can be made for you. Some homilists (people who offer the sermon) may print out notes for themselves; ask them if you could have a copy to read shortly before the service and get there early in order to do so. The readings and other special liturgical units that may be added on special Holy Days are standard on a three-year cycle: A, B, and C. Know which cycle you are in and get a copy of the missal so that you can read it beforehand. You can find the readings on-line at: <A HREF="http://www.usccb.org/nab/index.shtml">USCCB - Readings and Psalms for the month.</A> For translations into glossed ASL (written in English to show which signs to use) of the various readings, see <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Signing-Scriptures-Starting-Interpreting-Readings/dp/1568545606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212917375&sr=1-1">Signing the Scriptures, Year A</A> or <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Signing-Scriptures-Starting-Interpreting-Readings/dp/1568545134/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212917375&sr=1-2">Signing the Scriptures, Year C.</A> Most of the Scriptural readings have also been videotaped in ASL and can be purchased from <A HREF="../rlgn/chr.html#asl-bible">Deaf Missions.</A> I have translated the <A HREF="resp-psa/toc.html">Responsorial Psalms</A>.

<P><B>P:</B> In memory of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Father, this life-giving bread, this saving cup. We thank you for counting us worthy to stand in your presence and serve you. May all of us who share in the body and blood of Christ be brought together in the unity by the Holy Spirit. Lord, remember your Church throughout the world: make us grow in love, together with N. our Pope, N., our bishop, and all the clergy. Remember our brothers and sisters who have gone to their rest in the hope of rising again; bring them and all the departed the light of your presence. Have mercy on us all; make us worthy to share eternal life, with Mary, the virgin mother of God, with the apostles, with all the saints who have done your will throughout the ages. May we praise you in union with them, and give you glory through your Son, Jesus Christ.
