<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>We'll build a land where we bind up the broken. We'll build a land where the captives go free, where the oil of gladness dissolves all mourning. Oh, we'll build a promised land that can be.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Come build a land where sisters and brothers, anointed by God, may then create peace: where justice shall roll down like waters, and peace like an ever-flowing stream.

<P>We'll build a land where we bring the good tidings to all the afflicted and all those who mourn. And we'll give them garlands instead of ashes. Oh, we'll build a land where peace is born. 

<P>We'll be a land building up ancient cities, raising up devastations from old; restoring ruins of generations. Oh, we'll build a land of people so bold. 

<P>Come, build a land where the mantles of praises resound from spirits once faint and once weak; where like oaks of righteousness stand her people. Oh, come build the land, my people we seek.
