<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Go get a fragrant balsam bough 
<BR>To make a wreath for Advent now. 
<BR>Then light tall tapers, one by one, 
<BR>To welcome Mary's gentle Son.

<P>2. To see the radiance of His face 
<BR>For every creed and every race; 
<BR>A Light to follow where we tread,
<BR>To bless the breaking of our bread.

<P>3. Messiah, King and Prince of Peace,
<BR>He bring the hope that strife may cease,
<BR>That Love may triumph over wrong,
<BR>The message of the angel's song.

<P>4. Prepare a manger in your heart, 
<BR>A quiet place for Him apart
<BR>From earthly bustle, worldly din,
<BR>And bid the Christ Child enter in.
