<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>English translation</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

<P>1. Ye sons and daughters of the Lord,
<BR>the King of glory, King adored,
<BR>this day Himself from death restored.

<P>2. All in the early morning gray
<BR>went holy women on their way,
<BR>to see the tomb where Jesus lay.

<P>3. Of spices pure a precious store
<BR>in their pure hands these women bore,
<BR>to anoint the sacred Body o'er.

<P>4. The straightaway one in white they see,
<BR>who saith, "seek the Lord: but He
<BR>is risen and gone to Galilee."

<P>5. This told they Peter, told John;
<BR>who forthwith to the tomb are gone,
<BR>but Peter is by John outrun.

<P>6. That self-same night, while out of fear
<BR>the doors where shut, their Lord most dear
<BR>to His Apostles did appear.

<P>7. But Thomas, when of this he heard,
<BR>was doubtful of his brethren's word;
<BR>wherefore again there comes the Lord.

<P>8. "Thomas, behold my side," saith He;
<BR>"My hands, My feet, My body see,
<BR>and doubt not, but believe in Me."

<P>9. When Thomas saw that wounded side,
<BR>the truth no longer he denied;
<BR>"Thou art my Lord and God!" he cried.

<P>10. Oh, blest are they who have not seen
<BR>their Lord and yet believe in Him!
<BR>eternal life awaiteth them.

<P>11. Now let us praise the Lord most high,
<BR>and strive His name to magnify
<BR>on this great day, through earth and sky:

<P>12. Whose mercy ever runneth o'er;
<BR>Whom men and Angel hosts adore;
<BR>to Him be glory evermore.

<P><B>Latin original</B>

<P><B>R</B>: Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

<P>1. O filii et filiae,
<BR>Rex caelestis, Rex gloriae
<BR>morte surrexit hodie.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>2. Ex mane prima Sabbati
<BR>ad ostium monumenti
<BR>accesserunt discipuli.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>3. Et Maria Magdalene,
<BR>et Iacobi, et Salome
<BR>Venerunt corpus ungere
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>4. In albis sedens angelus
<BR>praedixit mulieribus:
<BR>In Galilaea est Dominus.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>5. Et Ioannes apostolus
<BR>cucurrit Petro citius,
<BR>monumento venit prius.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>6. Discipulis astantibus,
<BR>in medio stetit Christus,
<BR>dicens: Pax vobis omnibus.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>7. Ut intellexit Didymus
<BR>quia surrexerat Iesus,
<BR>remansit fere dubius.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>8. Vide Thoma, vide latus,
<BR>vide pedes, vide manus,
<BR>noli esse incredulus.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>9. Quando Thomas vidit Christum,
<BR>pedes, manus, latus suum,
<BR>dixit: Tu es Deus meus.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>10. Beati qui non viderunt
<BR>et firmiter crediderunt;
<BR>vitam aeternam habebunt.
<BR><B>R.</B>

<P>11. In hoc festo sanctissimo
<BR>sit laus et iubilatio:
<BR>benedicamus Domino.
<BR><B>R.</B> 

<P>12. Ex quibus nos humillimas
<BR>devotas atque debitas
<BR>Deo dicamus gratias.
