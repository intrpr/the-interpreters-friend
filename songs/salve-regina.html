<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> GREETINGS! - (2h)[B] alt. salute from the temples but with the PO away. 

<P>MARY - [M] touches NDS temple, is drawn across forehead, and descends. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/mary_a.swf">ASL Pro: Mary - 1.</A>

<P>MERCY - (2h)[open 8], POs > people who are receiving mercy, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest.

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly.

<P>EVE - [E], PO away, FO  up, taps DS of chin.

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>SO-MUCH - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, separate while "so much" is mouthed.

<P>FAR-AWAY - [1], twists while moving away with tongue shuttling from side to side. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/f/far.swf">ASL Pro: Far.</A>

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern.

<P>AND JESUS... Ford translates this line as "And Jesus - your Son, and Lord, your womb's most blessed fruit -", but my translation makes no mention of Soon or Lord. Ford has actually added this to the Latin original to have a syllable for each note in the plain song. I sometimes add signs to keep to the rhythm of the song, but here there would be too much to say and keep to the rhythm, so I omitted it. "your Son, and Lord" is not in the original Latin. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> 

<P>SOFT-HEARTED - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^] but hands close to heart.

<P>LOVING - LOVE+.

<P>VIRGIN - [V], PO away, FO up, brushes against DS of chin twice. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I put the Latin next to the glossing to make it easier if it is sung in Latin. Here is a translation by Paul Ford:

<P>Hail, Mary, Mother and Queen of tender mercy, 
<BR>our life, our comfort, and our hope, we hail you. 
<BR>From this foreign land Eve's sons and daughters cry to you. 
<BR>So lost, so full of fear, we mourn, we grieve,
<BR>we sigh from this tearful vale of exile.
<BR>Ah, then, our help, our advocate and guide
<BR>turn now to us the gaze of your all-loving eyes, so full of mercy.
<BR>And Jesus - your Son, and Lord, your womb's most blessed fruit -
<BR>show him to us when we complete our sojourn.
<BR>O gentle, O loving, O beloved O Virgin Mary.
