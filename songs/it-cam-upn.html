<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> LONG-AGO

<P>CLOSER+ - Like ARRIVE, but DH gets closer, then closer to the NDH.

<P>HARP - (2h)[open 8], move in circles, moving away and coming back as if gliding across the strings of a harp.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A>

<P><U>THEM</U> - Underlined prounouns (<U>ME</>, <U>YOU</>, <U>HE</U>) are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>MORE-AND-MORE - The sign MORE is repeated with the NDH held in place.

<P>WING - (2h)[B^] are held out like the final position of ANGEL and the FT are fluttered slightly. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>WIND BLOW - At first (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move in small figure-eights to show the wind and then in larger, faster figure-eights to show the strength of the wind. Both signs are not strictly necessary, but done here to follow the rhythm of the music. You will notice that a number of signs are repeated for the same reason.

<P>SETTLE-DOWN-ON - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend.  

<P>FLY - (2h)[B^] are held out like the final position of ANGEL and the arms show the wings flapping.

<P>ABOVE - Like COLLEGE but NDH is PO down. 

<P>HAVE-PITY-ON - (2h)[open 8], POs away, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest. 

<P>TALK-AROUND - Like GOSSIP, but opening and closing [O^]. 

<P>UP-TO-NOW - (2h)[1^], POs down, index fingers travel up the chest on the DS until they end (2h)[1], POs > singer, FOs up.

<P>SORROW - SAD.

<P>SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=67">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Sin.</A>

<P>BURDEN-PUSH+ - (2h)[B^] touch DS shoulder with FT and push down twice; each time the shoulder dips down > DS. 

<P>BEND-DOWN+ - [S] is held up like a head and the "head" bends down twice, further and further.

<P>WORK"over time" - The sign WORK has DH moves in vertical circles several times while mouthing "sta".

<P>LOOK"look++" - (2h)[V] point FTs > angels while mouthing "look look look". 

<P>SIT-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, hands descend slowly.

<P>PUT-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>HURRY-ON - HURRY.

<P>BIBLE - This sign varies according to denomination. The most frequent are JESUS BOOK, GOD BOOK and B-LAW. 

<P>YEARS-AND-YEARS - YEAR is repeated with effort.

<P>GO-IN-CYCLE+ - (2h)[1], POs towards, FOs >&lt;.  FT touch, DH moves in a circle normal (perpendicular) to the chest until FT touch again. This sign is repeated.

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A> 

<P>LOOK-FORWARD - (2h)[V] FTs point diagonally up and move slightly in that direction twice. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>#BACK-TO - [B], PO away, FO up, fingers curl, then staighten to a [K], while moving towards Heaven.

<P>COPY-above - Dorsal (back) side of NDH points > Heaven.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. It came upon the midnight clear,
<BR>That glorious song of old,
<BR>From angels bending near the earth,
<BR>To touch their harps of gold;
<BR>"Peace on the earth, good will to men,
<BR>From Heaven's all gracious King."
<BR>The world in solemn stillness lay,
<BR>To hear the angels sing.

<P>2. Still through the cloven skies they come
<BR>With peaceful wings unfurled,
<BR>And still their heavenly music floats
<BR>O'er all the weary world;
<BR>Above its sad and lowly plains,
<BR>They bend on hovering wing,
<BR>And ever over its Babel sounds
<BR>The blessèd angels sing.

<P>3. Yet with the woes of sin and strife
<BR>The world has suffered long;
<BR>Beneath the angel strain have rolled
<BR>Two thousand years of wrong;
<BR>And man, at war with man, hears not
<BR>The love-song which they bring;
<BR>O hush the noise, ye men of strife
<BR>And hear the angels sing.

<P>4. And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
<BR>Whose forms are bending low,
<BR>Who toil along the climbing way
<BR>With painful steps and slow,
<BR>Look now! for glad and golden hours
<BR>Come swiftly on the wing.
<BR>O rest beside the weary road,
<BR>And hear the angels sing!

<P>5. For lo! the days are hastening on,
<BR>By prophet-bards foretold,
<BR>When with the ever circling years
<BR>Comes round the age of gold;
<BR>When peace shall over all the earth
<BR>Its ancient splendors fling,
<BR>And the whole world send back the song
<BR>Which now the angels sing.
