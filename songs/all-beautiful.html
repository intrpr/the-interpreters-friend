<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>All beautiful the march of days, as seasons come and go;
<BR>The Hand that shaped the rose hath wrought the crystal of the snow;
<BR>Hath sent the hoary frost of Heav'n, the flowing waters sealed,
<BR>And laid a silent loveliness on hill and wood and field.

<P>O'er white expanses sparkling pure the radiant morns unfold;
<BR>The solemn splendors of the night burn brighter than the cold;
<BR>Life mounts in every throbbing vein, love deepens round the hearth,
<BR>And clearer sounds the angel hymn, "Good will to men on earth."

<P>O Thou from Whose unfathomed law the year in beauty flows,
<BR>Thyself the vision passing by in crystal and in rose,
<BR>Day unto day doth utter speech, and night to night proclaim,
<BR>In ever changing words of light, the wonder of Thy Name.
