<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>SOUL - NDH [C] or [S] is held close to body and [F] which inserts FT into NDH then slowly draws it upwards with a wavy path. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=65">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Spirit.</A> 

<P>BEAT - (2h)[S], DPO > NDS, NDPO down, FOs away, are held with DH on top of NDH and DH strikes NDH at wrist while index and middle fingers shoot out suddenly. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>EXHAUSTED - TIRED + [V], PO up, FO > NDS, is drawn with effort across the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. 

<P>DESERT - DRY THEREABOUTS. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/d/desert.swf">ASL Pro: Desert.</A>

<P>FLESH - Pinch cheek and pull it slightly side to side. 

<P>FAINT - Touch temple and (2h)[5] start from their respective sides and slide their palms against each other as they pass to the opposite side. 

<P>THINK-ABOUT - [1], PO > signer, circles temple.

<P>MULL-OVER - (2h)[O] is held at forehead and fingers pill-roll, that is thumb is rubbed against all the FT and back and hands alt. circle at forehead.

<P>WINGS - Second half of ANGEL: arms extended and bent move slightly as if flying gently. 

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>RAISE-UP - (2h)[5], POs up, FOs away, are raised up so that FO is up. 

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Oh God, I seek You. My soul thirsts for You. Your love is finer than life.

<P>1. As a dry and weary desert land, so my soul is thirsting for my God, and my flesh is faint for the God I seek, for Your love is more than life.

<P>2. I think of You when at night I rest. I reflect upon Your steadfast love. I will cling to You, Oh Lord my God. In the shadow of Your wings I sing.

<P>3. I will bless Your name all the days I live. I raise my hands and call on You. My joyful lips shall sing your praise. You alone have filled my hungry soul.
