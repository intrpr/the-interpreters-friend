<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Before the marvel of this night 
<BR>Adoring, fold your wings and bow, 
<BR>Then tear the sky apart with light 
<BR>And with your news the world endow. 
<BR>Proclaim the birth of Christ and peace, 
<BR>That fear and death and sorrow cease: 
<BR>Sing peace, sing peace, sing gift of peace! 

<P>Awake the sleeping world with song, 
<BR>This is the day our God has made. 
<BR>Assemble here, celestial throng, 
<BR>In royal splendor come arrayed. 
<BR>Give earth a glimpse of heav'nly bliss, 
<BR>A teasing taste of what they miss: 
<BR>Sing bliss, sing bliss, sing endless bliss! 

<P>The love that we have always known, 
<BR>Our constant joy and endless light, 
<BR>Now to the loveless world be shown, 
<BR>Now break upon it deathly night. 
<BR>Into one song compress the love 
<BR>that rules our universe above: 
<BR>Sing love, sing love, sing God is love!
