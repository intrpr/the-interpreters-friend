<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1&5. Two were bound for Emmaus, 
<BR>disheartened and lost; 
<BR>all their hope for the future 
<BR>had been nailed to a cross. 
<BR>Love unknown then walked beside them, 
<BR>come back from the dead, 
<BR>and they knew he was risen 
<BR>in the breaking of bread. 

<P>2. On the Sea of Tiberius, 
<BR>when the night was nearly gone 
<BR>and their toil seemed so useless, 
<BR>not one fish had they caught, 
<BR>from the shore the stranger called to them; 
<BR>"Cast your net, friends, once more." 
<BR>And they filled it to bursting, 
<BR>but the net was not torn. 

<P>3. Then they knew it was Jesus 
<BR>and they hastened in to shore; 
<BR>bread and fish for their breakfast 
<BR>from the hands of their Lord. 
<BR>"O Peter, if you love me 
<BR>you must care for my sheep; 
<BR>if you follow your Shepherd, 
<BR>then a shepherd you'll be." 

<P>4. When the road makes us weary, 
<BR>when our labour seems but loss, 
<BR>when the fire of faith weakens 
<BR>and too high seems the cost, 
<BR>let the Church turn to its risen Lord, 
<BR>who for us bore the cross, 
<BR>and we'll find our hearts burning 
<BR>at the sound of his voice.
