<P>1. In the little village of Bethlehem,
<BR>There lay a Child one day;
<BR>And the sky was bright with a holy light
<BR>O'er the place where Jesus lay.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Alleluia! O how the angels sang.
<BR>Alleluia! How it rang!
<BR>And the sky was bright with a holy light
<BR>'Twas the birthday of a King.

<P>2. 'Twas a humble birthplace, but O how much
<BR>God gave to us that day,
<BR>From the manger bed what a path has led,
<BR>What a perfect, holy way.
