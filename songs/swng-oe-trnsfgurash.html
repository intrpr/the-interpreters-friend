<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Transform us as you, transfigured, stood apart on Tabor's height. 
<BR>Lead us up our sacred mountains; search us with revealing light. 
<BR>Lift us from where we have fallen, full of questions, filled with fright.

<P>2. Transform us as you transfigured, once spoke with those holy ones. 
<BR>We, surrounded by the witness of those saints whose work is done, 
<BR>Live in this world as your Body, chosen daughters, chosen sons.

<P>3. Transform us as you transfigured, would not stay within a shrine. 
<BR>Keep us from our great temptation - time and truth we quickly bind. 
<BR>Lead us down those daily pathways, ||: where our love in not confined. :||
