<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>Rejoice, rejoice, believers, and let your lights appear.
<BR>The evening is advancing, and darker night is near.
<BR>The Bridegroom is arising, and soon He will draw nigh.
<BR>All watch in expectation! At midnight comes the cry.

<P>See that your lamps are burning; replenish them with oil.
<BR>Look now for your salvation, the end of earthly toil.
<BR>The marriage feast is waiting, and now the gates wide open stand;
<BR>Rise up, ye heirs of glory, the Bridegroom is at hand!

<P>'Mid hope and expectation, O Jesus, now appear!
<BR>Arise, Thou Sun so longed for, above this darker sphere!
<BR>With hearts and hands uplifted, we plead, O Lord, to see
<BR>The day of all the earthâ€™s redemption and ever be with Thee.

<P>Forever be with Thee!
