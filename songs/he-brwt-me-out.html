<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah's dread frown,
<BR>And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down;
<BR>I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
<BR>Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: He brought me out of the miry clay,
<BR>He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
<BR>He puts a song in my soul today,
<BR>A song of praise, hallelujah!

<P>2. He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
<BR>My steps were established and here I'll abide;
<BR>No danger of falling while here I remain,
<BR>But stand by His grace until the crown I gain. 

<P>3. He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise;
<BR>By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
<BR>My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free.
<BR>I'll praise my Redeemer, Who has rescued me.

<P>4. I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
<BR>I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
<BR>I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
<BR>Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God. 

<P>5. [I don't have the English lyrics for this last verse.]
