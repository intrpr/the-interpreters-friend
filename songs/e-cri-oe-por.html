<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>. 

<P>SOUL - NDH [C] or [S] is held close to body and [F] which inserts FT into NDH then slowly draws it upwards with a wavy path.

<P>alt.GIFT-TO-me - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands alt. flip > signer.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>PAY-OFF - [open 8] runs middle finger up palm (> wrist), changes to a [B], PO down, and then moves back across palm.

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern.

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> The Lord hears the cry of the poor;
<BR>Blessed be the Lord.

<P>1. I will bless the Lord at all times,
<BR>His praise ever in my mouth;
<BR>Let my soul glory in the Lord,
<BR>For He hears the cry of the poor.

<P>2, Let the lowly hear and be glad:
<BR>The Lord listens to their pleas;
<BR>And to hearts broken, God is near,
<BR>For He hears the cry of the poor.

<P>3. Every spirit crushed, God will save,
<BR>Will be ransom for their lives,
<BR>Will be safe shelter for their fears,
<BR>And will hear the cry of the poor.

<P>4. We proclaim you greatness, O God;
<BR>Your praise ever in our mouth;
<BR>Ev'ry face brightened in your light;
<BR>For you hear the cry of the poor.
