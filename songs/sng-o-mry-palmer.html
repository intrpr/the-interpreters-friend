<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Sing of Mary, pure and lowly, 
<BR>Virgin-Mother undefiled. 
<BR>Sing of God's own Son most holy, 
<BR>Who became her little child. 
<BR>Fairest child of fairest Mother, 
<BR>God the LORD who came to earth, 
<BR>Word made Flesh, our very Brother, 
<BR>Takes our nature by his birth.

<P>2. Sing of Jesus, son of Mary, 
<BR>In the home at Nazareth. 
<BR>Toil and labour cannot weary 
<BR>Love enduring unto death. 
<BR>Constant was the love he gave her, 
<BR>Though it drove him from her side, 
<BR>Forth to preach, and heal, and suffer, 
<BR>Till on Calvary he died.

<P>3. Sing of Mary, sing of Jesus, 
<BR>Holy Mother's holier son. 
<BR>From his throne in heaven he sees us, 
<BR>Thither calls us every one, 
<BR>Where he welcomes home his Mother 
<BR>To a place at his right hand, 
<BR>There his faithful servants gather,
<BR>There the crowned victors stand.

<P>4. Joyful Mother, full of gladness, 
<BR>In thine arms thy LORD was borne. 
<BR>Mournful Mother, full of sadness, 
<BR>All thy heart with pain was torn. 
<BR>Glorious Mother, now rewarded 
<BR>With a crown at Jesus' hand, 
<BR>Age to age thy name recorded 
<BR>Shall be blest in every land.

<P>5. Glory be to God the Father;
<BR>Glory be to God the Son; 
<BR>Glory be to God the Spirit; 
<BR>Glory to the Three in One. 
<BR>From the heart of blessed Mary, 
<BR>From all saints the song ascends, 
<BR>And the Church the strain re echoes 
<BR>Unto earth's remotest ends.
