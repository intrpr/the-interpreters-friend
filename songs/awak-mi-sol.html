<P>1. The image of God invisible,
<BR>The firstborn of all life,
<BR>Before and within, He holds it all in,
<BR>One name, one faith, one Christ.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> No one is good enough to save himself.
<BR>Awake my soul tonight to boast nothing else.

<P>2. I trust no other source or name.
<BR>Nowhere else can I hide.
<BR>This grace gives me fear, and this grace draws me near,
<BR>And all that it asks it provides. <B>Refrain</B>

<P><B>Bridge:</B> No seam in this garment,
<BR>All my rags to hide,
<BR>No less than your love for Jesus is mine.

<P>3. When I stand on the edges of Jordan
<BR>With the saints and the angels beside,
<BR>When my body is healed and the glory revealed,
<BR>Still I can boast only Christ. <B>Refrain</B> (2x)

<P><B>Refrain</B> (2x)
