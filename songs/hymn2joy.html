<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U>-ctr - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>TAKE-IN-BY-EYE/EAR - (2h)[3] moves > head of signer several times while the fingers (not thumb) curl to show either listening to spoken words or listening with the eyes to a signed message.

<P>SWEEP-IN-ROWS - (2h)[A dot], palms touch, FOs away, then DH moves > DS while NDH is held in place, then both hands repeat a little lower.

<P>(2h)bC-CL'revolve in space' - (2h)[bC] held up to frame the sky and hands revolve in small starts and stops.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth.

<P>EXPAND-ON - like the final part of HIT and the [S] - pullled away from the [1] and opens to a [5:]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/e/expand.swf">ASL Pro: Expand.</A>

<P>BIG-QUESTION - like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that is a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.

<P>GESTALT - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, are held side by side and the hands descend, supinate, and end with POs up by traveling in a circle.
