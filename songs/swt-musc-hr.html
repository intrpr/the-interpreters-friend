<BR>RED FLOWER IN STONE HANG-HEAD TOO, FAMOUS OFFER SLEEP.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> LIGHT-WEIGHT - I could have just written LIGHT, here it means not heavy, and I didn't want it to be confused with LIGHT as in "bright".

<P>BLOOM~'blow on bloom'~PETALS-DRIFT-DOWN - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together. While the hands are still in this position, blow on the fingers as if the wind came along and then (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend with wg. 

<P>OVERNIGHT - Hands are held like NIGHT and then the DH FT move down and under the NDH while the Dh remains in contact.

<P>SURFACE-QUIET - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, move like the surface of a lake where there are gentle waves.

<P>WALLS - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move away together indicating walls on each side.

<P>MOON - [bC], PO > NDS, FO up, surrounds the eye and touches, then moves upwards and > DS. 

<P>SHINE-DOWN - [O^] is held high PO > signer; hands open to [5^] while moving > signer. 

<P>REFLECT - [O^], PO away, FOs up, is brought to [B], PO away, FO up, and reflects off it while opening to [5]. 

<P>SHINY - (2h)[open 8], POs down, FOs away, twist rapidly at wrists while rising. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/s/shine.swf">ASL Pro: Shine.</A>  

<P>(2h)PEACE-SIGN - (2h)[V], POs away, FOs up, are held at shoulder level.

<P>DROWSY - (2h)[B^], PO down, FOs >&lt;, are held at eye level and alt. twist so that PO > signer as if eyelids were drooping.

<P>EYELIDS-CLOSE - (2h)[B^], PO down, FOs >&lt;, are held at eye level and  twist together so that PO > signer as if eyelids had closed.

<P>COVER - (2h)[B^], POs down, FOs away, DH is over NDH and brushes over it as it moves closer to the signer, almost like the first half of COMFORTABLE. 

<P>BRING-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs up, FOs away, moves from a high level down to and moves > signer. 

<P>CREEP-UP - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, wg while ascending in a curvy pattern like an ivy plant would make.

<P>LEAF - NDH [1] is held against wrist closest to thumb of [5] with DH wg. 

<P>DROOP - (2h)[5] are held up with very limp wrists and then descend like they are too heavy to hold up.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>HANG-HEAD - [S] is held up as if it were going to sign YES and then droops down with the head.
 
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>There is sweet music here that softer falls	 
<BR>Than petals from blown roses on the grass,	 
<BR>Or night-dews on still waters between walls	 
<BR>Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;	 
<BR>Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,	         
<BR>Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes;	 
<BR>Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.	 
<BR>Here are cool mosses deep,	 
<BR>And thro' the moss the ivies creep,	 
<BR>And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,	  
<BR>And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.
