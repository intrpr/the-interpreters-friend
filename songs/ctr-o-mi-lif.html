<P><B>Refrain:</B> O Lord, you are the center of my life: I will always praise you, I will always serve you, I will always keep you in my sight. 

<P>1. Keep me safe, O God, I will take refuge in you. I say to the Lord, "You are my God. My happiness lies in you alone; my happiness lies in you alone."

<P>2. I will bless the Lord who give me counsel, who even at night directs my heart. I keep the Lord ever in my sight: since he is at my right hand, I shall stand firm.

<P>3. And so my heart rejoices, my soul is glad;  even in safety  shall my body rest. For you will not leave my soul among the dead, nor let your beloved know decay.

<P>4. You will show me the path of life, the fullness of joy in your presence, at your right hand, at your right hand happpiness forever.
