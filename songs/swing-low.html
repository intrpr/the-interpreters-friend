<P><B>Refrain:</B> |: Swing low, sweet chariot,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home! :| 

<P>1. I looked over Jordan and what did I see,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home!
<BR>A band of angels comin' after me,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home! 

<P>2. If you get there before I do,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home,
<BR>Jess tell my friends that I'm acomin' too,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home. 

<P>3. I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home,
<BR>But still my soul feels heavenly bound
<BR>Comin' for to carry me home!
