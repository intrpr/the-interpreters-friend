<P>1. Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,
<BR>Whose trust, ever child-like, no cares could destroy,
<BR>Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,
<BR>Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day.

<P>2. Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,
<BR>Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe,
<BR>Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,
<BR>Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day.

<P>3. Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,
<BR>Your hands swift to welcome, your arms to embrace,
<BR>Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,
<BR>Your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day.

<P>4. Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm,
<BR>Whose voice is contentment, whose presence is balm,
<BR>Be there at our sleeping, and give us, we pray,
<BR>Your peace in our hearts, Lord, at the end of the day.
