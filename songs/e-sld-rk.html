<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> RIGHTEOUSNESS - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down.

<P><U>THEY</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>FALL-APART - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FTs interlaced, FTs move down while still interlaced to make POs down. 

<P>MURKY - Both hands start in handshape and orientation like TEACH, but the hands cross while opening to (2H)[5] and the dominant hand's palm rubs across the dorsal side (back hand) of NDH.

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A> 

<P>COMFORT - COMFORTABLE. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.  

<P>SHIP-TOSS - The sign BOAT weaves up and down as if tossed by the sea.

<P>ANCHOR - (2h)[F] interlink and are pulled down sharply like an anchor.

<P>COVENANT - AGREE RELATIONSHIP-WITH-God.

<P>PUT-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.  

<P>PULL-DOWN - (2h)[5:], POs up, FOs away, pull down as if grasping something while closing to (2h)[S]. 

<P>POW -  - Touch ear with index finger then (2h)[S], PO down, FO away, move antisymmetrically from side to side while mouthing "pow".</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/t/W4151.htm">ASL browser - thunder</A>.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>GO-WITH-TO-Heaven - (2h)[A] are held with knuckles touching as in TOGETHER and both hands move up to Heaven. 

<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS -  - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down. 

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly. 

<P>THRONE - SIT + (2h)[B:], POs down, FOs away, behave as if they were on the arms of a throne.

<P>ABSOLVE - EXCUSE is signed once, dominance is reversed and EXCUSE is signed again.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. My hope is built on nothing less
<BR>Than Jesus' blood an righteousness
<BR>I dare not trust the sweetest frame
<BR>But wholly lean on Jesus' name

<P><B>Refrain:</B> On Christ the solid rock I stand
<BR>All other ground is sinking sand
<BR>All other ground is sinking sand

<P>2. When darkness veils his lovely face
<BR>I rest on His unchanging grace
<BR>In ev'ry high and stormy gale
<BR>My anchor holds within the veil

<P>3. His oath, his covenant, his blood
<BR>Support me in the whelming flood
<BR>When all around my soul gives way
<BR>He then is all my hope and stay

<P>4. When He shall come with trumpet sound
<BR>Oh, may I then in Him be found
<BR>Dressed in his righteousness alone
<BR>Faultless to stand before the throne
