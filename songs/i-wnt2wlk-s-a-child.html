<P>1. I want to walk as a child of the light.

<BR>God set the stars to give light to the world.
<BR>The star of my life is Jesus.

<BR>I want to look at Jesus.
<BR>Clear sun of righteousness, shine on my path.
<BR>And show me the way to the Father.

<P>3. I'm looking for the coming of Christ.
<BR>I want to be with Jesus.
<BR>When we have run with patience the race,
<BR>We shall know the joy of Jesus.
