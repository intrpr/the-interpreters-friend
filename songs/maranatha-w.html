<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>LIGHT-SHINE-DOWN - [O^] is held high PO > signer; hands open to [5^] while moving > signer.

<P>STRAY-LEFT-AND-RIGHT - like the sign OFF-THE-POINT but the DH flicks index finger to one side and then to the other side; it's another way to sign the concept "sin".STRIVE-FOR-GOAL - Hands are oriented like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle as if trying to get to the goal, but not yet successful.

<P>NO-MORE - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P>OPPRESSION-OFF - Starts like PRESSURE, DH [B], PO down, FO away, push down slightly on [S], PO > DS, FO away, then the DH is brought upwards suddenly and the signer mouths "off".

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Come Lord, Come Lord Jesus. Give your people hope. Come Lord, Come Lord Jesus, and lead your people home.
