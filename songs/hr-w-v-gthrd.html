<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Here we have gathered, gathered side by side.
<BR>Circle of kinship, come and step inside! 
<BR>May all who seek here find a kindly word; 
<BR>May all who speak here feel they have been heard. 
<BR>Sing now together, this our hearts' own song. 

<P>2. Here we have gathered, called to celebrate
<BR>Days of our lifetime, matters small and great; 
<BR>We of all ages, women, children, men, 
<BR>Infants and sages, sharing what we can.
<BR>Sing now together this, our hearts' own song. 

<P>3. Life has its battles, sorrows and regret:
<BR>But in the shadows, let us not forget:
<BR>We who now gather know each other's pain; 
<BR>Kindness can heal us; as we give, we gain. 
<BR>Sing now in friendship, this our hearts' own song.
