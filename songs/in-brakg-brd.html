<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In the walking on the road, we saw him. 
<BR>In the telling of our hopes, we saw him. 
<BR>In the burning of our hearts, we saw the Lord. 
<BR>At the meal he took the bread and then he blessed it, broke it, offered it. 
<BR>In the breaking of the bread, we saw him!
<BR>Suddenly our eyes were opened, and we knew he was alive! 

<P>2. We set out to find his friends to tell them. 
<BR>We went to Jerusalem to tell them; 
<BR>and with joy we told them, "We have seen the Lord!" 
<BR>And as we were speaking there, he stood among us, blessed us, said to us, 
<BR>"Now my peace I leave with you." We saw him! 
<BR>Suddenly our eyes were opened, and we knew he was alive! 

<P>3. But then we became afraid without him. 
<BR>In the darkened room we stayed without him, 
<BR>waiting for the One he said that he would send. 
<BR>Then the Spirit of the Lord came down upon us, 
<BR>filling us, changing us, giving us the strength to say: 
<BR>We saw him! Suddenly our eyes were opened, and we knew he was alive! 

<P>4. We ran out into the street to tell them, 
<BR>everyone that we could meet, to tell them, 
<BR>"God has raised him up and we have seen the Lord!" 
<BR>We took bread as he had done and then we blessed it, broke it, offered it. 
<BR>In the breaking of the bread, we saw him! 
<BR>Suddenly our eyes were opened. 

<P>There within our midst was Jesus, and we knew he was alive. 
<BR>In the breaking of the bread, he is here with us again, 
<BR>and we know he is alive. Alleluia!
