<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BETHLEHEM - "B" CITY. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_bethlehem.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Bethlehem.</A> Note: Because BETHLEHEM already has CITY in the sign, I translated "O little town" as LITTLE PLACE to avoid the redundancy of LITTLE CITY CALLED "B" CITY.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!
<BR>Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
<BR>Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;
<BR>The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

<P>2. For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
<BR>While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.
<BR>O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,
<BR>And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!

<P>3. How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv'n;
<BR>So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His Heav'n.
<BR>No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,
<BR>Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.

<P>4. Where children pure and happy pray to the blessèd Child,
<BR>Where misery cries out to Thee, Son of the mother mild;
<BR>Where charity stands watching and faith holds wide the door,
<BR>The dark night wakes, the glory breaks, and Christmas comes once more.

<P>5. O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;
<BR>Cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today.
<BR>We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;
<BR>O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!
