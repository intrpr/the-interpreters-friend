<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> You are child of the universe, 
<BR>you are no less than the tress and the stars.
<BR>You are child of the Lord of Light,
<BR>be still and know I am God, you are child.

<P>1. Oh Lord my God, how great, how glorious.
<BR>Your Name resounds in all the earth.
<BR>Yet You have made us just less than Angels 
<BR>and You have fashioned us to rule the earth.

<P>2. When I behold the works Your hands have made; 
<BR>the moon and stars which you arranged.
<BR>Lord what is man? Lord what is woman? 
<BR>What is the child of these that You should care?

<P>3. Oh Lord my God, it is for You I long;
<BR>my body aches, my spirit thirsts.
<BR>So will I praise You, so will I bless You
<BR>my soul clings fast to You, I shout for joy.
