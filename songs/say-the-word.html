<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Full of life, full of God, hail full of grace! You who bringlove to earth, hope to our race, "Where is our God?" the people will cry, searching the world, scanning the sky in vain. It couldn't be clearer, it's plain! Look in the mirror. Who could have planned it? Who understand it? Who but my one love, the God of surprise! Old was Sarah, David small, and yet God chose us all. . . since he chose me, I choose him. I cannot refuse him. What must I do? Say the word! 

<P>Full of life, full of God, hail full of grace! You who bringlove to earth, hope to our race, "Where is our God?" the people will cry, searching the world, scanning the sky in vain. It couldn't be clearer, it's plain! Look in the mirror.

<P>What must I do? Say the word!
