<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> <P><B>Antiphon</B>: ||: I will praise your name, my King and my God. :||

<P>1. I will give you glory, my God and King, and I will bless your name forever. Every day I will bless and praise your name forever. 

<P>2. The Lord is full of grace and mercy. He is kind and slow to anger. He is good in all His works and full of compassion. 

<P>3. Let all your works give you thanks, O Lord, and let all the faithful bless you. Let them speak of your might, O Lord, the glory of your kingdom. 

<P>4. The Lord is faithful in all His words, and always near. His name is holy. He lifts up all those who fall. He raises up the lowly.
