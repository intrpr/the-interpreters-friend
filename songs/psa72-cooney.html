<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Justice shall flourish in his time, and fullness of peace forever. 

<P><B>Alternate refrain:</B> Every nation on earth will adore you.

<P>1. O God, with your judgment
<BR>endow the king,
<BR>and with your justice, the king's son;
<BR>he shall govern your people
<BR>with justice
<BR>and your afflicted ones with judgment.

<P>2. Justice shall flower in his days,
<BR>and profound peace, 
<BR>'til the moon be no more.
<BR>May he rule from sea to sea,
<BR>from the River to the ends of the earth.

<P>3. From the island and Tarshish
<BR>shall kings come with gifts;
<BR>from Arabia and Sheba they come.
<BR>All the kings of the earth pay him homage;
<BR>all the nations shall serve him.

<P>4. For he shall rescue the poor 
<BR>when he cries out,
<BR>and the afflicted
<BR>when he has no one to help him.
<BR>He shall have pity for the lowly and poor;
<BR>the lives of the poor he shall save.

<P>5. May his name be blessed forever,
<BR>and while the sun lasts
<BR>his name shall remain.
<BR>In him shall all the tribes
<BR>of the earth be blessed;
<BR>all the nations 
<BR>shall proclaim his happiness.
