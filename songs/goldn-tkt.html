<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I never thought my life could be anything but catastrophe! But suddenly I begin to see a bit of good luck for me! 'Cos I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden twinkle in my eye! I never had a chance to shine. Never a happy song to sing. But suddenly half the world is mine! What an amazing thing! 'Cos I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden sun up in my sky! I never thought I'd see the day when I would face the world and say, "Good morning. Look at the sun!" I never thought that I would be slap in the lap of luxury! 'Cause I'd have said it couldn't be done! But it <I>can</I> be done! I never dreamed that I would climb over the moon in ecstasy; But nevertheless it's there that I'm shortly about to be! 'Cos I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way! And with a golden ticket it's a golden day!
