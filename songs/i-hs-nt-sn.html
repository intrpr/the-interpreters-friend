<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Eye has not seen, ear has not heard what God has ready for those who love him; Spirit of love, come, give us the mind of Jesus, teach us the wisdom of God.

<P>1. When pain and sorrow weigh us down, be near to us, O Lord, forgive the weakness of our faith, and bear us up within your peaceful word.

<P>2. Our lives are but a single breath, we flower and we fade, yet all our days are in your hands, so we return in love what love has made.

<P>3. To those who see with eyes of faith, the Lord is ever near, reflected in the faces of all the poor and lowly of the world.

<P>4. We sing a mystery from the past, in halls where saints have trod, yet ever new the music rings to Jesus, Living Song of God.
