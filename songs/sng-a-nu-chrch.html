<P>1. Summoned by the God who made us rich in our diversity, gathered in the name of Jesus, richer still in unity.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Let us bring the gifts that differ and, in splendid, varied ways, sing a new church into being, one in faith and love and praise.

<P>2. Radiant risen from the water, robed in holiness and light, male and female in God's image, male and female, God's delight.

<P>3. Trust the goodness of creation; trust the Spirit strong within. Dare to dream the vision promised, sprung from seed of what has been.

<P>4. Bring the hopes of every nation; bring the art of every race. Weave a song of peace and justice; let it sound through time and space.

<P>5. Draw together at one table, all the human family; shape a circle ever wider and a people ever free.
