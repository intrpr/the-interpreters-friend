<BR>With hosannas in the highest to our Savior and our King!

<P>2. Alleluia! Alleluia! Like the sun from out the wave, 
<BR>He has risen up in triumph from the darkness of the grave. 
<BR>He's the splendor of the nations. He's the lamp of endless day; 
<BR>He's the very Lord of glory who is risen up today!

<P>3. Alleluia! Alleluia! Blessed Jesus, make us rise
<BR>From the life of this corruption to the life that never dies. 
<BR>May your glory be our portion, when the days of time are past, 
<BR>And the dead shall be awakened by the trumpet's mighty blast!
