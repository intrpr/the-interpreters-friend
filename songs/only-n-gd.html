<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SOUL - NDH [C] or [S] is held close to body and [F] which inserts FT into NDH then slowly draws it upwards with a wavy path.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Only in God is my soul at rest, 
<BR>in him comes my salvation.  
<BR>He only is my rock, 
<BR>my strength and my salvation.  

<P>My stronghold, my Savior, 
<BR>I shall not be afraid at all.  
<BR>My stronghold, my Savior.  
<BR>I shall not be moved.  

<P>Only in God is found safety, 
<BR>when my enemy pursues me.  
<BR>Only in God is found glory,
<BR>when I am found meek and found lowly.  

<P>My stronghold, my Savior, 
<BR>I shall not be afraid at all.  
<BR>My stronghold, my Savior.  
<BR>I shall not be moved.  

<BR>Only in God is my soul at rest, 
<BR>in him comes my salvation.
