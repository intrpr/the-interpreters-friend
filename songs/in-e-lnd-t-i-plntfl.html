<BR>When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be Your name
<BR>Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be Your glorious name

<P>2. Blessed be Your name, when the sun's shining down on me.
<BR>When the world's 'all as it should be, blessed be Your name.
<BR>And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering. 
<BR>Though there's pain in the offering, blessed be Your name.

<P>3. Every blessing You pour out, I'll turn back to praise.
<BR>When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say:

<P><B>Refrain</B> (x2)
