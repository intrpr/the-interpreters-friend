<P>FOCUS 1-HERE NOW.  FOCUS B-HERE PLACE.  ENJOY, CHERISH OUR MOMENT. FEEL SPIRIT COOPERATE.  STRUGGLE, HIGH-GOAL++, HURRY PUSH-ASIDE.  ALL YOUR"all" ENERGY ACCEPT RIGHT-NOW.  LATER MEAN LATER.  OTHER PLACE, OTHER PEOPLE, DIFFERENT REASON, FINE++.  BUT RIGHT-NOW, FOCUS 1-HERE NOW.  OUR MOMENT VANISH  WILL.  RIGHT-NOW CHERISH ENJOY, BEFORE GONE.  MOMENT WE SHARE RIGHT-NOW BECOME OUR GIFT.  MOMENT"each", TOTAL OUR LIFE. MOMENT"each", SHOULD CELEBRATE.  EACH PLACE WE V:-CL'set ourselves', BECOME OUR B-HERE. THINK-ABOUT DEEP 1-HERE NOW.  WHERE? 1-HERE.  WHEN?  NOW.  SEEM SIMPLE NOTHING-TO-IT.  NOT-THAT.  HARD.  WE LOOK-BACK'frantic', LOOK-FORWARD'frantic'.  BETTER OVER-THERE-left. BETTER OVER-THRE-right.  YESTERDAY BETTER.  TOMORROW BETTER.  (2h)STOP! FOCUS 1-HERE NOW.
 
<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> 1-HERE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, move down to indicate this exact place.

<P>B-HERE - (2h)[B], POs up, FOs away, circle symmetrically in a plane parallel to the floor.

<P>HIGH-GOAL++ - Like GOAL, but the NDH is held high and the DH moves in a circle perpendicular to the floor as if working its way to this high goal.        

<P>PUSH-ASIDE - (2h)[B],  with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.  

<P>RIGHT-NOW - NOW which moves slightly up and down with the DS of mouth drawn down exposing teeth as in the sign RECENT.

<P>MOMENT - The sign SECOND (1/60th of a minute).

<P>VANISH - (2h)[5^], DH PO down and above the NDH which is PO up, both have FO away.  The two hands separate quickly while hands close to (2h)[O^].

<P>V:-CL'set ourselves' - Like SIT but the DH is a [V:] and it descend slowly and deliberately.

<P>NOT-THAT - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, wave from side to side symmetrically.

<P>OVER-THERE - [B], PO up, FO > whereever you want to spatialize this.

<P>WE LOOK-BACK'frantic' . . . TOMORROW BETTER.  This entire section can be signed with a frantic look on the face as if one were stressed out.

<P>(2h)STOP! - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, move forward like the hearing gesture for "Stop!" or "Talk to the hand."

<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B>

<BR>Be here now.
<BR>Be here in this place.
<BR>Be here in this precious time.
<BR>Be here with this particular company.
<BR>Let us for a moment forget where we have to be 
<BR>And when we must be there.
<BR>Let us for a time invest all our energy in here and now.
<BR>There is a time to be somewhere else
<BR>And with some other company
<BR>And for some other reason.
<BR>For this moment, be here now.
<BR>Focus on the moment before it flits away,
<BR>Pay attention to this treasured instant of time
<BR>Before it is gone.
<BR>These times of here and now are really all we have;
<BR>This is the pattern of our lives - these successive instants of being.
<BR>Celebrate these intervals of time we call now
<BR>And cherish these places of being we call here.
<BR>Contemplate the here and now - here and now.
<BR>It seems so simple, but it is so hard,
<BR>We are so distracted by then and there.
<BR>It is so tempting to live somewhere else,
<BR>To think of some other time.
<BR>Be here now, and be glad.
