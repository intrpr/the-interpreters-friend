<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
<BR>Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more,
<BR>But the Master of the sea, heard my despairing cry,
<BR>From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
<BR>When nothing else could help
<BR>Love lifted me!

<P>2. All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I'll cling
<BR>In His bless&egrave;d presence live, ever His praises sing,
<BR>Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul's best songs,
<BR>Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs. 

<P>3. Souls in danger look above, Jesus completely saves,
<BR>He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves.
<BR>He's the Master of the sea, billows His will obey,
<BR>He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.
