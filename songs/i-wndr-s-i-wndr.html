<P>COME-DOWN-FROM-Heaven - [1], PO > signer, FO up, moves down from high above as if it were Jesus coming from Heaven.

<P>BIRD-FLY - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and hands flap like wings while showing the path of the flight.

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I wonder as I wander out under the sky, 
<BR>How Jesus the Savior did come for to die. 
<BR>For poor on'ry people like you and like I. 
<BR>I wonder as I wander out under the sky. 

<P>When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall, 
<BR>With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all. 
<BR>But high from God's heaven a star's light did fall, 
<BR>And the promise of ages it then did recall. 

<P>If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing, 
<BR>A star in the sky, or a bird on the wing, 
<BR>Or all of God's angels in heav'n for to sing, 
<BR>He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.
