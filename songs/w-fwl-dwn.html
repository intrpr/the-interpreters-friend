<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. 

<P>CROWN~LAY-DOWN - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) place crown on head then move the hands as if to lay it as Jesus' feet.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>REDEEMER - R-FREE AGENT.

<P>SAVIOR - S-FREE AGENT.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>We fall down.
<BR>We lay our crowns
<BR>At the feet of Jesus.
<BR>The greatness of mercy and love
<BR>At the feet of Jesus.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: (3x) And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy" :||
Is the Lamb.

<P>My Jesus, I love you.
<BR>I know thou are mine.
<BR>To thee all the follies of sin I resent.
<BR>My gracious redeemer,
<BR>My savior, art thou.
<BR>If ever I'll love you,
<BR>My Jesus tis now.
