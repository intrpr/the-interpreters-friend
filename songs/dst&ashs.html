<P>1. Dust and ashes touch our face,
<BR>mark our failure and our falling.

<BR>take us as disciples,
<BR>washed and wakened by your calling.

<BR>lead us through the desert sands,
<BR>bring us living water,
<BR>Holy Spirit, come.

<P>2. Dust and ashes soil our hands 
<BR>greed of market, pride of nation. 
<BR>Holy Spirit, come, 
<BR>walk with us tomorrow,
<BR>as we pray and struggle
<BR>through the meshes of oppression. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. Dust and ashes choke our tongue
<BR>in the wasteland of depression.
<BR>Holy Spirit, come,
<BR>walk with us tomorrow,
