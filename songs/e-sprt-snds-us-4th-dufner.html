<P>1. The Spirit sends us forth to serve;
<BR>We go in Jesus' name
<BR>To bring glad tidings to the poor,
<BR>God's favour to proclaim. 

<P>2. We go to comfort those who mourn
<BR>And set the burdened free;
<BR>Where hope is dim, to share a dream
<BR>And help the blind to see.

<P>3. We go to be the hands of Christ,
<BR>To scatter joy like seed
<BR>And all our days to cherish life,
<BR>To do the loving deed. 

<P>4. Then let us go to serve in peace,
<BR>The gospel to proclaim.
<BR>God's Spirit has empowered us;
<BR>We go in Jesus' name.
