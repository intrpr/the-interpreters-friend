<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>O come, O come, Emmanuel,
<BR>And ransom captive Israel,
<BR>That mourns in lonely exile here
<BR>Until the Son of God appear.

<P>Rejoice! Rejoice!
<BR>Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

<P>Angels sent from God above 
<BR>now proclaim the birth is near.
<BR>They await the King of Love, 
<BR>singing loud for all to hear!

<P>Gloria, in excelsius Deo.

<P>(Divided choir:) 
<BR>In peace and love, (Angels raise a joyful cheer.) 
<BR>come down to dwell. (Come to us on earth to dwell!)
<BR>O holy child, (We rejoice Your birth is near.)
<BR>Emmanuel. (Come to us, Emmanuel!)

<P>(Both, but staggered:) 
<BR>Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
<BR>and shine on us, O Lord of Light!
<BR>In peace and love, come down this night,
<BR>O Lord of Light!
