<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In the tender compassion of our God, a new dawn has broken upon us; to shine on those who dwell in darkness, and to guide our feet along the ways of peace.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> And the Light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never overcome it; and the Light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness will never overcome it.

<P>2. He was in the world, the world was made through Him; yet those living then knew him not. To His own He came, His own rejected Him; but to those who believe in Him, He has given the power to be children of our God.

<P>3. Jesus is the Light of the world, shining in the face of darkness; those who walk in the ways of the Lord have the Light of Life.

<P>4. So we, too, are lights of the world, shining in the face of darkness;  so all can see, in the justice of our lives, God's prophetic Word.
