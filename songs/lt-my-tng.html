<P><B>Refrain:</B> Let my tongue be silenced, if ever I forget you!

<P>1. By the streams of Babylon, we sat and wept remembering Zion. On the willows of that land we hung our harps.

<P>2. There our captors asked of us the hymns of Zion. Our tormentors cried out: "Sing for us!"

<P>3. How shall we sing in a foreign land? If I forget you Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.

<P>4. Let my tongue be silenced if ever I forget you. If I prize not Jerusalem above all joy.
