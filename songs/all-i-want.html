<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> GO-TOWARDS-GOAL is like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>TRUE-BIZ is TRUE + S-BUSINESS.

<P>REACH-UP-TO is both hands reaching up to Heaven.

<P>GO-AHEAD is (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.

<P>BURNING-FROM-Heaven-TO-inside-self is (2h)[5wg] moves from high above signer to signer's chest.   

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>All I want to do is love you.
<BR>All I want to do is worship you.
<BR>All I want to do is lay down,
<BR>Right at your feet.

<P>As I lift my hands to heaven,
<BR>Let your fire fall down on me.
<BR>Rekindle the fire within me, Lord,
<BR>Once again.
