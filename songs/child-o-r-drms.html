<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Holy child of poverty, so lowly is your birth;
<BR>sharing our humanity, embracing all the earth;
<BR>Every nation, every race, every person wears your face;
<BR>Come anew, O child of our dreams.

<P>2. Joyful Child of mystery, come warm our winter night;
<BR>fire our dull complacency and fill us with your light;
<BR>Speak the Word that makes us whole, lead each lost and hungry soul;
<BR>Come anew, O child of our dreams.

<P>3. Sacred Child of ecstacy, creation sings your love;
<BR>light gives back your radiency and fills the skies above;
<BR>Gentle glow from candlelight, splendor of the stars of night;
<BR>Come anew, O child of our dreams.

<P>4. Child of all eternity, our justice and our peace;
<BR>born into our history that hatreds all may cease;
<BR>Bring us all to life from death, be our hope, our joy, our breath;
<BR>Come anew, O child of our dreams.
