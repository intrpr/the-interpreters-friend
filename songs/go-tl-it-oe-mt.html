<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Go, tell it on the mountain,
<BR>Over the hills and everywhere
<BR>Go, tell it on the mountain,
<BR>That Jesus Christ is born.

<P>While shepherds kept their watching
<BR>Over silent flocks by night
<BR>Behold throughout the heavens
<BR>There shone a holy light.

<P>The shepherds feared and trembled,
<BR>When lo! above the earth,
<BR>Rang out the angels chorus
<BR>That hailed the Saviorâ€™s birth.

<P>Down in a lowly manger
<BR>The humble Christ was born
<BR>And God sent us salvation
<BR>That bless&eacute;d Christmas morn.
