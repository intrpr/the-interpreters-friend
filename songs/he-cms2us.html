<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. He comes to us as one unknown,
<BR>a breath unseen, unheard;
<BR>as though within a heart of stone,
<BR>or shriveled seed in darkness sown,
<BR>a pulse of being stirred,
<BR>a pulse of being stirred.

<P>2. He comes when souls in silence lie
<BR>and thoughts of day depart,
<BR>half-seen upon the inward eye,
<BR>a falling star across the sky
<BR>of night within the heart,
<BR>of night within the heart.

<P>3. He comes to us in sound of seas,
<BR>the ocean's fume and foam;
<BR>yet small and still upon the breeze,
<BR>a wind that stirs the tops of trees,
<BR>a voice to call us home,
<BR>a voice to call us home.

<P>4. He comes in love as once he came
<BR>by flesh and blood and birth;
<BR>to bear within our mortal frame
<BR>a life, a death, a saving name
<BR>for every child of earth,
<BR>for every child of earth.

<P>5. He comes in truth when faith is grown;
<BR>believed, obeyed, adored:
<BR>the Christ in all the scriptures shown,
<BR>as yet unseen, but not unknown,
<BR>our Savior, and our Lord,
<BR>our Savior, and our Lord.
