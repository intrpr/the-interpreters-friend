<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>"Joseph dearest, Joseph mine,
<BR>Help me cradle the child divine;
<BR>God reward thee and All that's thine
<BR>In paradise,"
<BR>So prays the mother Mary.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: He came among us at Christmastide,
<BR>At Christmastide, in Bethlehem;
<BR>Men shall bring Him from far and wide
<BR>Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus,
<BR>Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!

<P>"Gladly, dear one, lady mine,
<BR>Help I cradle this child of thine;
<BR>God's own light on us both shall shine
<BR>In paradise,
<BR>As prays the mother Mary." 

<P>Peace to all that have goodwill!
<BR>God, who heaven and earth doth fill,
<BR>Comes to turn us away from ill,
<BR>And lies so still
<BR>Within the crib of Mary. 

<P>All shall come and bow the knee,
<BR>Wise and happy their souls shall be.
<BR>Loving such a divinity
<BR>As all may see
<BR>In Jesus, Son of Mary. 

<P>Now is born Emmanual,
<BR>Prophesied once by Ezekiel,
<BR>Promised Mary by Gabriel,
<BR>Ah, who can tell
<BR>Thy praises, Son of Mary.  

<P>Thou my lazy heart hast stirred,
<BR>Thou, the Father's eternal Word,
<BR>Greater than aught that ear has heard,
<BR>Thou tiny bird
<BR>Of love, thou Son of Mary. 

<P>Sweet and lovely little one,
<BR>Thou princely, beautiful, God's own Son,
<BR>Without thee all of us were undone;
<BR>Our love is Won
<BR>By thing, O Son of Mary. 

<P>Little man, and God indeed,
<BR>Little and poor, thou art all we need;
<BR>We will follow where thou dost lead,
<BR>And we will heed
<BR>Our brother, born of Mary.
