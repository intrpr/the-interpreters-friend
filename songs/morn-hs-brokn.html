<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Morning has broken like the first morning;
<BR>Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.
<BR>Praise for the singing! Praise for the morning!
<BR>Praise for them springing fresh from the Word!

<P>2. Sweet the rain's new fall sunlit from heaven,
<BR>Like the first dewfall on the first grass.
<BR>Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,
<BR>Sprung in completeness where His feet pass.

<P>3. Mine is the sunlight! Mine is the morning,
<BR>Born of the one light Eden saw play!
<BR>Praise with elation; praise ev'ry morning,
<BR>God's recreation of the new day!
