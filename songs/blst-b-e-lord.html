<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Blest be the Lord, blest be the Lord,
<BR>The God of mercy, the God who saves.
<BR>I shall not fear, the dark of night
<BR>Nor the arrow that flies by day.

<P>He will release me from the nets of sinful men.
<BR>He will protect me from their wicked hands.
<BR>Beneath the shadow of His wings I will rejoice
<BR>To find a dwelling place secure.

<P>I need not shrink before the terrors of the night
<BR>Nor stand alone before the light of day.
<BR>No harm shall come to me, no arrow strike me down, 
<BR>No evil settle in my soul.

<P>Although a thousand men have fallen at my side,
<BR>I'll not be shaken with the Lord at hand.
<BR>His faithful love is all the armor that I need
<BR>To wage my battle with my foe.
