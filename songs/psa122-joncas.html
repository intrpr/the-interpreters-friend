<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord. :||

<P>1. I rejoiced when I heard them say: 
<BR>"Let us go to the house of the Lord,"
<BR>and now our feet are standing 
<BR>within your gates, O Jerusalem.
 
<P>2. Jerusalem is a city 
<BR>built with unity and strength.
<BR>It is there, it is there that the tribes go up, 
<BR>the tribes of the Lord.
 
<P>3. For Israel's law it is 
<BR>to praise God's name and there to give God thanks.
<BR>There are set the judgment thrones
<BR>for all of David's house.
 
<P>4. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! 
<BR>"May those who love you prosper;
<BR>May peace ever reign within your walls, 
<BR>and wealth within your buildings!"

<P>5. For love of my family and love of my friends,
<BR>I pray that peace be yours.
<BR>For love of the house of the Lord our God
<BR>I pray for your good.
