<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Love one another as I have loved you.
<BR>Care for each other, I have cared for you.
<BR>Bear each other's burdens. Bind each other's wounds;
<BR>and so you will know my return.

<P>My friends, do you know what I have done for you?
<BR>I have washed your feet with my hands.
<BR>If I, your Lord, have knelt at your feet,
<BR>you should do at each other's feet as I have done for you.

<P>When the world will hate you and revile you
<BR>when they laugh at your care for the poor,
<BR>when they hold you in darkness and imprison your tongues,
<BR>remember how they listened to me.
