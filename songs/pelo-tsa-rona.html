<P>1. Hallelujah! We sing your praises, all our hearts are filled with gladness.
Christ the Lord said to us: I am wine, I am bread; give to all who thirst and hunger.

<P>2. Hallelujah! We sing your praises, all our hearts are filled with gladness.
Now he sends us all out strong in faith, free of doubt, proclaim the good news.
