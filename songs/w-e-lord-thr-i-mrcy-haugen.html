<P>1. From out of the depths, I cry unto you. 
<BR>Lord, hear my voice; come hear my prayer;
<BR>Oh let your ear be open to my pleading.

<P>2. If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt,
<BR>then who could stand within your sight?
<BR>But in you is found forgiveness for our failings.

<P>3. Just as those who wait for the morning light, 
<BR>even more I long for the Lord, my God,
<BR>and his word to me shall ever be my comfort.
