<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "Blessed be [God]!", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]".

<P>CRAZY-FOR - [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side. 

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A>

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>#BACK-TOGETHER-God - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held with NDH close to the body and the DH high and close to where God is spatialized. The hands transition to a C and then a K while rushing towards each other and contacting. 

<P>GO-TOWARDS-HIGH-GOAL - Like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process and the NDH hand is held relatively high.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Blessed be God! O blessed be God! Who call you by name! Holy and chosen one!

<P>1. Come, and return to the Lord! Live by the Word of God, who calls you by name!

<P>2. Seek to be children of light! Live in the love of God, who calls you by name!

<P>3. Sing now with all your heart! Praise and glory be to our God, who calls you by name!
