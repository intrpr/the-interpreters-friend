<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> "Tears in Heaven" is a heartfelt ballad written and performed by Eric Clapton about the pain he felt following the 1991 death of his four-year-old son, Conor, who fell from a 53rd-story window in his mother's New York City condominium. - <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_in_Heaven">WIKIPEDIA.</A>

<P>me-WONDER - [1], PO > temple, FO up, FT circles around temple. I just added the "me" to show what it means contextually.

<P>OPPRESSED - DH [B], PO down, FO > NDS, pushs down on [S], PO > DS, FO away, which is held against chest.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Would you know my name
<BR>If I saw you in heaven?
<BR>Would it be the same
<BR>If I saw you in heaven?
<BR>I must be strong
<BR>And carry on,
<BR>'Cause I know I don't belong
<BR>Here in heaven.

<BR>Would you hold my hand 
<BR>If I saw you in heaven 
<BR>Would you help me stand 
<BR>If I saw you in heaven 
<BR>I'll find my way
<BR>Through night and day,
<BR>'Cause I know I just can't stay
<BR>Here in heaven.

<P>Time can bring you down,
<BR>Time can bend your knees.
<BR>Time can break your heart,
<BR>Have you begging please, 
<BR>begging please.

<P>(instrumental) 

<P>Beyond the door,
<BR>There's peace I'm sure,
<BR>And I know there'll be no more
<BR>Tears in heaven.

<P>Would you know my name
<BR>If I saw you in heaven?
<BR>Will it be the same
<BR>If I saw you in heaven?
<BR>I must be strong
<BR>And carry on,

<P>'Cause I know I don't belong
<BR>Here in heaven. (2x)
