<P><B>Refrain:</B> The Lord has done great things for us. 
<BR>We are filled with gladness and joy. 

<P>1. When God set the captives of Zion free,

<BR>They you could hear our laughter and cheers; 
<BR>then you could hear our shouts of joy.

<BR>"Indeed, God has done great things for them."
<BR>Truly our God has done great things,
<BR>and so we are glad, we shout for joy.

<P>3. Restore all our fortunes, God of love,
<BR>like rivers that save the desert lands.
<BR>Those who have gone to sow in tears
<BR>shall go back to reap with songs of joy.
