<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I rejoiced when they said to me, "Let us go unto the house of the Lord," standing there, O Jerusalem, in your gates, unto the house of the Lord.

<P>1. Look upon Jerusalem, the city now restored. 
<BR>Here the tribes of Yahweh come as one unto the Lord.

<P>2. As He ordered Israel, they come to praise His name, 
<BR>here where courts of justice, the courts of David reign.

<P>3. Pray for peace, Jerusalem, prosperity at home, 
<BR>peace inside your city walls that come from God alone.

<P>4. Since we are God's people, I say, "Peace be to You!"
<BR>May the God who dwells in us, your hapiness renew.
