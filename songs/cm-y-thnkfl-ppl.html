<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, ye thankful people, come, raise the song of harvest home;
<BR>All is safely gathered in, ere the winter storms begin.
<BR>God our Maker doth provide for our wants to be supplied;
<BR>Come to God's own temple, come, raise the song of harvest home.

<P>2. All the world is God's own field, fruit unto His praise to yield;
<BR>Wheat and tares together sown unto joy or sorrow grown.
<BR>First the blade and then the ear, then the full corn shall appear;
<BR>Lord of harvest, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be.

<P>3. For the Lord our God shall come, and shall take His harvest home;
<BR>From His field shall in that day all offenses purge away,
<BR>Giving angels charge at last in the fire the tares to cast;
<BR>But the fruitful ears to store in His garner evermore.

<P>4. Even so, Lord, quickly come, bring Thy final harvest home;
<BR>Gather Thou Thy people in, free from sorrow, free from sin,
<BR>There, forever purified, in Thy garner to abide;
<BR>Come, with all Thine angels come, raise the glorious harvest home.
