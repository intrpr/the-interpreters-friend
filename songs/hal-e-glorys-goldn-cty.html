<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Hail the glorious golden city,
<BR>Pictured by the seers of old!
<BR>Everlasting light shines o’er it,
<BR>Wondrous tales of it are told:
<BR>Only righteous men and women
<BR>Dwell within its gleaming wall;
<BR>Wrong is banished from its borders,
<BR>Justice reigns supreme o’er all.

<P>We are builders of that city,
<BR>All our joys and all our groans
<BR>Help to rear its shining ramparts;
<BR>All our lives are building stones:
<BR>Whether humble or exalted,
<BR>All are called to task divine;
<BR>All must aid alike to carry
<BR><BR>Forward one sublime design.

<P>And the work that we have builded,
<BR>Oft with bleeding hands and tears,
<BR>Oft in error, oft in anguish,
<BR>Will not perish with our years:
<BR>It will live and shine transfigured,
<BR>In the final reign of right;
<BR>It will pass into the splendors
<BR>Of the city of the light.
