<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.

<P>1. I will bless the Lord at all times. 
<BR>Praise shall always be on my lips; 
<BR>my soul shall glory in the Lord
<BR>for God has been so good to me.

<P>2. Glorify the Lord with me. 
<BR>Together let us all praise God's name. 
<BR>I called the Lord who answered me; 
<BR>from all my troubles I was set free. 

<P>3. Worship the Lord, all you people. 
<BR>You'll want for nothing if you ask. 
<BR>Taste and see that the Lord is good; 
<BR>in God we need put all our trust.

<P><B>Webmaster</B>: Verses 4-10 may have been added by Kelly Weisensel. There are from Psalms, but I am not sure if Moore included them in his original setting.

<P>4. Fear the Lord you holy ones; 
<BR>Nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
<BR>The powerful grow poor and hungry, 
<BR>But those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.

<P>5. Come children listen to me. 
<BR>I will teach you the ways of the Lord.
<BR>Who among you loves life, 
<BR>Takes delight in prosperous days?

<P>6. Keep your tongue from evil,
<BR>Your lips from speaking lies.
<BR>Turn from evil and do good;
<BR>Seek peace and pursue it.

<P>7. The Lord has eyes for the just 
<BR>And ears for their cry.
<BR>The Lord's face is against all evildoers
<BR>To wipe out their memory from all the earth.

<P>8. When the just cry out, the Lord hears
<BR>And rescues them from all distress.
<BR>The Lord is close to the broken hearted,  
<BR>Saves those whose spirit is crushed.

<P>9. Many are the troubles of the just,
<BR>But the Lord delivers them all.
<BR>God watches over all their bones.
<BR>Not a one shall be broken.

<P>10. Evil will slay the wicked; 
<BR>Those who hate the just are condemned.
<BR>The Lord redeems loyal servants. 
<BR>No one is condemned whose refuge is God.
