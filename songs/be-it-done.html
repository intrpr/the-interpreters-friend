<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> <U>ME</U> ACCEPT THAT GOD CHOSE-me <U>ME</U> VIRGIN-BIRTH GIVE-BIRTH HIS ONLY SON.

<P>1. UNIVERSE ITSELF INSIDE-SELF <U>YOU</U>. SEEM IMPOSSIBLE  <U>YOU</U> INSIDE-SELF <U>ME</U>. BUT <U>ME</U> KNOW-THAT <U>YOU</U> MAKE US COPY-You. NOW MY-TURN MAKE SOMETHING LIKE <U>YOU</U>.

<P>2. JESUS SAY (role play to rt) <U>THIS</U>-me MY BODY. <U>THIS</U>-me MY BLOOD. TAKE-UP AND ACCEPT. (role play to lf) (<) EUCHARIST, (>) WINE, NOW BECOME <U>YOU</U>, CHILD FROM <U>ME</U>. <U>ME</U> IDEA~LIKE TREE, AND <U>YOU</U> MY FRUIT.

<P>3. <U>ME</U> LOVE <U>YOU</U>-lf, WITHOUT END. MY LOVE WIDE AND DEEP. SPEAR PIERCE YOUR LEFT-SIDE, HURT <U>ME</U> TOO.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. The refrain is loosely translated because GO-AHEAD DO TO <U>ME</U> signed twice is not very inspiring. An expansion of the meaning is preferable.

<P>VIRGIN-BIRTH - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, are held so that the DH is above the NDH and both are in front of chest. The hands open to (2h)[4^].

<P>GIVE-BIRTH - S-BORN.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>MY-TURN - [L], PO > signer, FO > NDS, rotates so that thumb is pointing at chest.

<P>JESUS SAY - The original does not identify the speaker, but since a role play is necessary to show who is speaking, the speaker must be identified.

<P><U>THIS</U>-me - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs > signer, run the dorsal (back) side of fingers down chest.

<P>TAKE-UP - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, move down quickly and close to (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, as if grabbing hold of something, then hands ascend. 

<P>(role play to lf) - This is Mary's response to her son. 

<P>EUCHARIST - [F], PO > signer's face, FO up, makes the sign of the cross at the mouth.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>SPEAR - [S], PO > NDS, FO up, shakes the spear without releasing. The English is "arrow", but since this is a poetic reference to the spear that would pierce Jesus' side at the cruxifiction, it seems clearer to refer to it less obliquely.

<P>PIERCE - DH index finger pierces between index and middle fingers of NDH. 

<P>LEFT-SIDE - Run left hand (despite your dominance) down your left side. ALthough the text does not specify, this is the side Jesus will be pierced.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: Be it done unto me. :||

<P>1. How can you who emcompass all things be encompassed by me? In whose image I'm wondrously made, be made, then, of me.

<P>2. This my body and this my blood: take and receive. They are you now, O child of my womb. O fruit of my tree.

<P>3. I will love you with an unfailing love, so wide and so deep, that the arrow that pierces your side will surely pierce me.
