<P>Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
<BR>It's the best time of the year
<BR>I don't know if there'll be snow,
<BR>but have a cup of cheer.
<BR>Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
<BR>And when you walk down the street
<BR>Say Hello to friends you know
<BR>and everyone you meet.

<P>Oh, ho, the mistletoe
<BR>hung where you can see;
<BR>Somebody waits for you;
<BR>Kiss her once for me.
<BR>Have a holly jolly Christmas,
<BR>and in case you didn't hear,
<BR>Oh by golly, have a holly,
<BR>jolly Christmas this year.
