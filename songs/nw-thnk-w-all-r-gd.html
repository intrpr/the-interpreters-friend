<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Now thank we all our God, 
<BR>With heart and hands and voices,
<BR>Who wondrous things has done, 
<BR>In Whom this world rejoices;
<BR>Who from our mothers’ arms 
<BR>Has blessed us on our way
<BR>With countless gifts of love, 
<BR>And still is ours today.

<P>2. O may this bounteous God 
<BR>Through all our life be near us,
<BR>With ever joyful hearts 
<BR>And bless&egrave;d peace to cheer us;
<BR>And keep us in His grace, 
<BR>And guide us when perplexed;
<BR>And free us from all ills, 
<BR>In this world and the next!

<P>3. All praise and thanks to God 
<BR>The Father now be given;
<BR>The Son and Him Who reigns 
<BR>With Them in highest Heaven;
<BR>The one eternal God, 
<BR>Whom earth and Heaven adore;
<BR>For thus it was, is now, 
<BR>And shall be evermore.
