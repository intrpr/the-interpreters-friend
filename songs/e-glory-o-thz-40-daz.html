<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. The glory of these forty days
<BR>We celebrate with songs of praise;
<BR>For Christ, by whom all things were made,
<BR>Himself has fasted and has prayed.

<P>2. Alone and fasting Moses saw
<BR>The loving God who gave the Law;
<BR>And to Elijah, fasting, came
<BR>The steeds and chariots of flame.

<P>3. So Daniel trained his mystic sight,
<BR>Delivered from the lions' might;
<BR>And John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became
<BR>The herald of Messiah’s name.

<P>4. Then grant us, Lord, like them to be
<BR>Full oft in fast and prayer with thee;
<BR>Our spirits strengthen with thy grace,
<BR>And give us joy to see thy face.

<P>5. Father and Son and Spirit blest,
<BR>To thee be every prayer addrest,
<BR>Who art in Threefold Name adored,
<BR>From age to age, the only Lord. Amen.
