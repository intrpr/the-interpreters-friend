<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Once upon a time in a far off land
<BR>Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
<BR>Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
<BR>Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light

<P>They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
<BR>Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
<BR>They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
<BR>And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

<P>Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
<BR>Or guide a weary world into the light of day
<BR>And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
<BR>So once again we all can be children for awhile

<P>Now all around the world, in every iittle town
<BR>Everyday is heard a precious little sound
<BR>And every mother kind and every father proud
<BR>Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed
