<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Holy darkness, blessed night, 
<BR>heaven's answer hidden from our sight. 
<BR>As we await you, o God of silence, 
<BR>we embrace your holy night.

<P>1. I have tried you in fires of affliction;
<BR>I have taught your soul to grieve.
<BR>In the barren soil of your loneliness
<BR>there I ill plant my seed.

<P>2. I have taught you the price of compassion;
<BR>you have stood before the grave.
<BR>Though my love can seem like a raging storm
<BR>this is the love that saves.

<P>3. Were you there when I raised up the mountains?
<BR>Can you guide the morning star?
<BR>Does the hawk take flight when you give command?
<BR>Why do you doubt my power?

<P>4. In your deepest hour of darkness
<BR>I will give you wealth untold.
<BR>When the silence stills your spirit,
<BR>will my riches fill your soul.

<P>5. As the watchman waits for morning,
<BR>and the bride awaits her groom,
<BR>so we wait to hear your footsteps
<BR>as we rest beneath your moon.
