<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SCREWED-UP - (2h)[5:], FOs away, DH PO down and held high on its side, ND PO up and held low on its side. Both hands reverse POs and placement. 

<P>FALL-IN-DROPS - (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, alt. flick out index fingers and ascend and descend slightly.

<P>alt.F-CL'plop++' - (2h)[F], POs >&lt;, FOs away, alt. ascend and descend slightly while mouthing 'plop'.

<P>PATH'wavy lead to Heaven' - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move like a road that travels from the signer in a wavy path > Heaven.

<P>RAINBOW - COLOR + NDH [B], PO up, FO away, DH [4] touches FT to NDH palm and sweeps a large arc.

<P>THERE - Honorific index points to Heaven.

<P>PANE - (2h)[1], draw outline of window, then cross to indicate the caulking that divides a window into quadrants.

<P>PAST* - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DH comes from "behind" NDH and rapidly passes it.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  
 
<P>FAR-AWAY - [1], twists while moving away with tongue shuttling from side to side. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/f/far.swf">ASL Pro: Far.</A> 

<P>DARE - FT of [F], FOs > NDS, strike chin. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>CLOUDS - (2h)[5:], move similar to GROUP but with a wavy motion.

<P>PASS-BENEATH-ME++ - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, are held close to one another and move down and > the nack of the signer as if passing beneath.

<P>CANDY-DROP - [1], twists against cheek then flicks the index finger into the mouth like popping candy.

<P>FLAP-WINGS-HEADING-UP - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and gently flap as the hands move diagonally upwards to heaveh

<P>FARTHER-WINGS-HEADING-UP TRAVEL-UP BECOME-TINY - (This is signed during the long hold on "I" at the end of the song.) The previous sign glossed aboe moves only a little before it is replaced by (2h)[1] crossed at wrist, then [V:], PO down, then [G], PO > NDS, closing to a [bO^]. All of these signs should flow together and follow one diagonal line towards Heaven.        

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When all the world is a hopeless jumble 
<BR>and the raindrops tumble all around, 
<BR>Heaven opens a magic lane. 
<BR>When all the clouds darken up the skyway, 
<BR>there's a rainbow highway to be found, 
<BR>leading from your window pane 
<BR>to a place behind the sun, 
<BR>just a step beyond the rain.

<P><B>Chorus:</B> Somewhere over the rainbow
<BR>Way up high,
<BR>There's a land that I heard of
<BR>Once in a lullaby. 

<P>Somewhere over the rainbow
<BR>Skies are blue,
<BR>And the dreams that you dare to dream
<BR>Really do come true.

<BR><P>Someday I'll wish upon a star
<BR>And wake up where the clouds are far
<BR>Behind me.
<BR>Where troubles melt like lemon drops
<BR>Away above the chimney tops
<BR>That's where you'll find me.

<P>Somewhere over the rainbow
<BR>Bluebirds fly.
<BR>Birds fly over the rainbow.
<BR>Why then, oh why can't I?

<P>If happy little bluebirds fly
<BR>Beyond the rainbow
<BR>Why, oh why can't I?
