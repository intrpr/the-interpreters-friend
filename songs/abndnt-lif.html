<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We cannot own the sunlit sky, the moon, the wild-flowers growing,
<BR>For we are part of all that is within life’s river flowing.
<BR>With open hands receive and share the gifts of God’s creation,
<BR>That all may have abundant life in every earthly nation.

<P>2. When bodies shiver in the night and weary wait for morning,
<BR>When children have no bread but tears, and war horns sound their warning.
<BR>God calls humanity to awake, to join in common labor,
<BR>That all may have abundant life, oneness with their neighbor.

<P>3. God calls humanity to join as partners in creating 
<BR>A future free from want or fear. Life’s goodness celebrating, 
<BR>That new world beckons from afar, Invites our shared endeavor 
<BR>That all might have abundant life and peace endure forever.
