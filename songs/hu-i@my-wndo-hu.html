<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Who is at my window? Who? Who?
<BR>Go from my window! Go! Go!
<BR>Who calls there, like a stranger?
<BR>Go from my window! Go!

<P>--Lord, I am here, a wretched mortal,
<BR>That for Thy mercy doth cry and plead
<BR>Unto Thee, my Lord celestial,
<BR>'Tis me at Thy window, me--

<P>Remember thy sin. Remember thy sort.
<BR>And also for thee remember my part,
<BR>Remember the spear that sundered my heart,
<BR>And in at my Door thou shalt go.
	  	
<P>I ask no thing of thee therefore,
<BR>But love for love, to lay in store.
<BR>Give me thy heart; I ask no more,
<BR>And in at my Door thou shalt go.

<P>Who is at my window? Who?
<BR>Go from my window! Go!
<BR>Cry no more there, like a stranger,
<BR>But in at my Door thou go!
