<P>HOLD-CLOSE - Mime hugging something close to your body. 

<P><U>THERE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Like a shepherd he feeds his flock, and gathers the lambs in His arms, holding them carefully close to His heart, leading them home. 

<P>1. Say to the cities of Judah: Prepare the way of the Lord. Go to the mountain top lift your voice. Jerusalem, here is your God.

<P>2. I myself will shepherd them, for others have led them astray. The lost I will rescue and heal their wounds, and pasture them giving them rest.

<P>3. Come unto me if you are heavily burdened and take my yoke upon 
your shoulders. I will give you rest.
