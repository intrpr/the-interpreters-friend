<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> #ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder.

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - Like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>HOMOGENOUS - (2h)[Y], POs down, FOs away, circle horizontally. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/S/W3838.htm">ASL browser - standard</A>.

<P>lf-PUT-UP-BARRIER - (2h)[B], cross at wrists and are held up as a barrier.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>BEAT-us - (2h)[S], POs down, NDH FO away, but DH PO > signer, are held with DH on top of NDH and DH bends back fist and strikes NDH at wrist while fist continues to move down.

<P>(1 of 4) and the following numbers in parentheses are NDH [4], PO > signer, FO > DS, and DH [1] touches the appropriate NDH FT depending on which number is shown.  

<P>LIST-OF-4-SAME - NDH [4], PO > signer, FO up, and DH [Y] moves side to side above the FT of NDH. 

<P>TOP-PRIORITY - Palm of DH [5] strikes index finger of [5], PO > signer, FO > DS.

<P>JUST-RIGHT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, move forward slightly and abruptly.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P>JUST-ONE - [1], PO away, FO up, twists down and around until it is PO > signer, FO up. 

<P>TAKE-OFF - Like DEVELOP but moves quicklt and abruptly with a "po". 

<P>PAH - LIKE SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>.
