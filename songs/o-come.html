<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<BR>O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
<BR>Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!

<P><B>Refrain</B>: O come let us adore Him, (3 times) Christ the Lord.

<P>2. True God of true God, Light from Light Eternal,
<BR>Lo, He shuns not the Virgin's womb;
<BR>Son of the Father, begotten, not created;

<P>3. Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;
<BR>O sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
<BR>Glory to God, all glory in the highest;

<P>4. See how the shepherds, summoned to His cradle,
<BR>Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
<BR>We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps;

<P>5. Lo! star led chieftains, Magi, Christ adoring,
<BR>Offer Him incense, gold, and myrrh;
<BR>We to the Christ Child bring our hearts' oblations.

<P>6. Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger,
<BR>We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;
<BR>Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly?

<P>7. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
<BR>Jesus, to Thee be glory given;
<BR>Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.
