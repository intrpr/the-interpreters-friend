<P>REALLY-WANT PEACE LIVE INSIDE-SELF,

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>UNDERSTANDING - alt.UNDERSTAND.

<P>KEEP-IN-MIND - [A dot], touches thumb to temple and twists slightly.

<P>DETERMINED - Like STUBBORN, but with a more positive, but determined facial expression.

<P>KISS-FIST - Kiss the dorsal side (back) of hand to show you loves something other than a person.

<P>May peace dwell within our hearts,
<BR>And understanding in our minds;
<BR>May courage steel our wills,
<BR>And the love of truth forever guide us.
