<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Cold are the people, winter of life. 
<BR>We tremble in shadows this cold endless night. 
<BR>Frozen in snow lie roses sleeping, 
<BR>Flowers that will echo the sunrise. 
<BR>Fire of hope is our only warmth. 
<BR>Weary, its flame will be dying soon. 

<P>2. Voice in the distance, call in the night. 
<BR>On wind you enfold us. You speak of the light. 
<BR>Gentle on the ear you whisper softly, 
<BR>Rumors of a dawn so embracing. 
<BR>Breathless love awaits darkened souls. 
<BR>Soon will we know of the morning.

<P>3. Spirit among us, shine like the star. 
<BR>Your light that guides shepherds and kings from afar. 
<BR>Shimmer in the sky so empty, 
<BR>Lonely, rising in the warmth of your Son's love: 
<BR>Star unknowing of night and day. 
<BR>Spirit we wait for your loving Son.
