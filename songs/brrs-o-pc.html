<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. People of Jesus, trusted to be 
<BR>bearers of peace from God's living tree, 
<BR>peace that the world itself cannot know, 
<BR>the peace that is given to plant and to grow.

<P>2. Feel for the ones who have no more bread; 
<BR>feel for the ones with children unfed.
<BR>Longing for food, they find in our hands
<BR>a mountain of weapons more sacred than land.

<P>3. Feel for the ones whose homes are destroyed;
<BR>feel for the lives now shattered and void.
<BR>Waiting for loved ones nobody saw:
<BR>the innocent people who suffer in war.

<P>4. Stand with the ones who see a new way: 
<BR>people of faith who struggle and pray
<BR>given the call to shape and rebuild
<BR>our actions, our consciences, our broken world.

<P>5. Pray for the day our children will see
<BR>war strange and distant as slavery.
<BR>Work for a world where new ways abound
<BR>to meet and to dialogue till peace is found.

<P>6. Why spend your tears on what cannot heal?
<BR>Why spend your rage on what you conceal?
<BR>God's living Word cries out to reveal 
<BR>a love that will satisfy, hope that is real.

<P>7. Children of peace, go forth through the earth,
<BR>healing our world and bringing to birth
<BR>vision to build and fashion a way:
<BR>the fullness of life for God's people today.
