<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Let the valleys be raised and the mountains made low. 
Every meadow and field overturn. Make the pathway straight 
and the highway smooth for the coming of God in our day.

<P>1. God, you come to your people as you promised of old. 
You have raised up a Savior in the sight of us all.

<P>2. You, little child, go before him like the prophets of old.
bringing news of his coming by the mercy of God.

<P>3. God, you come like the morning on the darkness of night, 
as a light to the people, like the breaking of day.
