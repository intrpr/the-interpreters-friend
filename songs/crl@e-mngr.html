<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Holy Child within the manger,
<BR>Long ago yet ever near;
<BR>Come as friend to every stranger;
<BR>Come as hope for every fear. 
<BR>As you lived to heal the broken, 
<BR>Greet the outcast, free the bound.
<BR>As you taught us love unspoken,
<BR>Teach us now where you are found.

<P>2. Once again we tell the story --
<BR>How your love for us was shown,
<BR>When the image of your glory
<BR>Wore an image like our own.
<BR>Come, enlighten with your wisdom;
<BR>Come and fill us with your grace.
<BR>May the fire of your compassion
<BR>Kindle every land and race.

<P>3. Holy Child within the manger,
<BR>Lead us ever in your way,
<BR>So we see in every stranger
<BR>How you come to us today.
<BR>In our lives and in our living
<BR>Give us strength to live as you,
<BR>That our hearts might be forgiving
<BR>And our spirits strong and true.
