<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: (6x) HOSANNA. :||

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>HOSANNA - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, down almost to the knees and make them circle up repeatedly in a plane normal (perpendicular) to the chest until they rise up to the level of the head. If you are interested in the word, itself, read on. From the Hebrew "Hoshia na (Save us, please)", but because of the scene of the Triumphal Entry (of Jesus into Jerusalem before the Crucifixion) where the crowd calls this out to him, this has been traditionally used as an exclamation of joy.

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> 

<P><U>HIM</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>KING-DAVID - D-KING.

<P>FOREFATHERS - PARENTS + (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move in a vertical circle while moving back over shoulder. 

<P>RULE - CONTROL.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Hosanna.

<P>1. Blessed is he, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! 

<P>2. Blesed is the reign of our father David! Blessed is the reign of our father David to come!
