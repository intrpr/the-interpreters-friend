<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Wherever you go, I will follow,
<BR>Wherever you live is my home
<BR>Though days be of blessing or sorrow
<BR>Though house be of canvas or stone
<BR>Though Eden be lost to the past
<BR>Though mountains before us be vast
<BR>Wherever you go I am with you
<BR>I never will leave you alone.

<P>2. Whatever you dream, I am with you
<BR>When stars call your name in the night.
<BR>Though shadows and mist cloud the future
<BR>Together we bear there a light
<BR>Like Abram and Sara we stand
<BR>With only a promise in hand
<BR>But lead where you dream, I will follow
<BR>To dream with you is my delight.

<P>3. And though you should fall, you will find me
<BR>When no other friend can you claim
<BR>Thoses foes beat you down or betray you
<BR>And others desert you in shame
<BR>When home and dreams aren't enough
<BR>And you run away from my love
<BR>I'll raise you from where you have fallen
<BR>Faithful to you, is my name.

<P>4. Wherever you die, I will be there
<BR>To sing you to sleep with a psalm.
<BR>To soothe you with tales of our journey
<BR>Your fears and your doubts I will calm
<BR>We'll live, when journeys are done,
<BR>Forever in mem'ry as one
<BR>And we will be buried together
<BR>And waken to greet a new dawn.

<P>5. Wherever you go I will follow
<BR>Behold the horizon shines clear
<BR>The possible gleams like a city
<BR>Together we've nothing to fear
<BR>So speak with words bold and true
<BR>The message my heart speaks to you
<BR>You won't be alone, I have promised
<BR>Wherever you go, I am here
<BR>Wherever you go, I am here.
