<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
<BR>It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
<BR>Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
<BR>Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
<BR>A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
<BR>For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
<BR>Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
<BR>O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
<BR>O night, O holy night, O night divine!

<P>2. Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
<BR>With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
<BR>So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
<BR>Here came the wise men from Orient land.
<BR>The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
<BR>In all our trials born to be our Friend!
<BR>He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger.
<BR>||: Behold your King; before Him lowly bend! :||

<P>3. Truly He taught us to love one another;
<BR>His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
<BR>Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
<BR>And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
<BR>Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
<BR>Let all within us praise His holy Name!
<BR>Christ is the Lord! O praise His name forever!
<BR>||: His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim! :||
