<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B>

<P>Today, the twenty-fifth day of December
<BR>Unknown ages from the time when God created the heavens and the earth 
<BR>And then formed man and woman in his own image.
<BR>Several thousand years after the flood,
<BR>When God made the rainbow shine forth as a sign of the covenant.
<BR>Twenty-one centuries from the time of Abraham and Sarah;
<BR>Thirteen centuries after Moses led the people of Israel out of Egypt.
<BR>Eleven hundred years from the time of Ruth and the Judges;
<BR>One thousand years from the anointing of David as king;
<BR>In the sixty-fifth week according to the prophecy of Daniel.
<BR>In the one hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad;
<BR>The seven hundred and fifty-second year from the foundation of the city of Rome.
<BR>The forty-second year of the reign of Octavian Augustus; 
<BR>The whole world being at peace,
<BR>Jesus Christ, eternal God and Son of the eternal Father,
<BR>Desiring to sanctify the world by his most merciful coming,
<BR>Being conceived by the Holy Spirit,
<BR>And nine months having passed since his conception,
<BR>Was born in Bethlehem of Judea of the Virgin Mary.
<BR>Today is the nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh.
