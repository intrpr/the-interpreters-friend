<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Rock of Ages, let our song
<BR>Praise Thy saving power;
<BR>Thou, amidst the raging foes,
<BR>Wast our sheltering tower.
<BR>Furious they assailed us,
<BR>But Thine arm availed us,
<BR>And Thy Word
<BR>Broke their sword
<BR>When our own strength failed us.

<P>2. Kindling new the holy lamps,
<BR>Priests, approved in suffering,
<BR>Purified the nationâ€™s shrine,
<BR>Brought to God their offering.
<BR>And His courts surrounding
<BR>Hear, in joy abounding,
<BR>Happy throngs,
<BR>Singing songs
<BR>With a mighty sounding.

<P>3. Children of the martyr race,
<BR>Whether free or fettered,
<BR>Wake the echoes of the songs
<BR>Where ye may be scattered.
<BR>Yours the message cheering
<BR>That the time is nearing
<BR>Which will see
<BR>All men free,
<BR>Tyrants disappearing.
