<P>SHAKE-OUT-HAND, HOLD-WRIST-IN-PAIN. 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> MUSCULAR - BIG is made at the shoulders + (2h)[4], POs > signer, FOs >&lt;, hands travel down chest fluttering the fingers to show the washboard abs.

<P><U>HE</U>-rt - Honorific index, using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>(pick up slip of paper, see note) FS:'Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz' - In this parody of "The girl from Ipanema", the author makes fun of romantic sounding names by throwing in two cities (I know at least one of them exists) that have incredibly long names.  To add to the humor, when I performed this with the Rochester Gay Men's Chorus, I prepared a slip of long narrow slip of paper to emphasize the play on length and actually wrote out the two city names that will be fingerspelled.  I tried to actually fingerspell them accurately but with exaggerated effort as part of the comedy.    
  
<P>TURNED-ON - EXCITED or INSPIRED with appropriate facial expression.

<P>PANT - A mime with the [5] hand at the chest and breathing hard with open mouth.

<P>#GO-rt - [5^], PO > signer, FO up, hands moves away > rt and closes to an [O^].

<P>SCRATCH-HEAD - A mime where the [5:] scratches the DS of the head in perplexity.

<P>BIG-QUESTION - Like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that is a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.
 
<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>COOL - [5] is held with thumb against chest, FO up, and wg.  

<P>rt-LOOK-ME-OVER - [V], points fingers at face as if the boy is looking at the signer, then the hands slowly nods down and up as if the signer is getting the "once over".

<P>COVER-SMILE - [B] covers mouth to hide smile.

<P>LOUD"pow" - [1] touches ear, then (2h)[S], PO down, FO away, move antisymmetrically from side to side and mouth "pow" with eyes squinting. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/S/W3763.htm">ASL browser - sound</A>.

<P>TRUE~BIZ - TRUE + S-BUSINESS.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>MODEL - (2h)[F], FO up, alt. move to and fro at elbows in an feminine manner with <U>mm</U>.

<P>SCRATCH-CHIN - [G] sourrouns chin and is pulled down twice while maintaining contact with the chin as if trying to figure something out.

<P>SHAKE-OUT-HAND, HOLD-WRIST-IN-PAIN - a mime where the interpreter pretends to have fingerspelled too much (FUNNY~NONE?), shaking out the hand from too much FS, holding and flexing wrist in discomfort.
        
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Tall and tender, like an Apollo,
<BR>He goes walking by, and I have to follow him,
<BR>The boy from Tacarembo La Tumbe Del Fuego Santa Malipas Zatatecas La Junta Del Sol Y Cruz.
<BR>When we meet, I feel I'm on fire
<BR>And I'm breathless every time I enquire,
<BR>"How are things in Tacarembo La Tumbe Del Fuego Santa Malipas Zatatecas La Junta Del Sol Y Cruz?" 

<P>Why, when I speak, does he vanish?
<BR>Why is he acting so clannish?
<BR>I wish I understood Spanish.
<BR>When I tell him I think he's the end,
<BR>He giggles a lot with his friend.

<P>Tall and slender, moves like a dancer,
<BR>But I never seem to get any answer,
<BR>From the boy from Tacarembo La Tumbe Del Fuego Santa Malipas Zatatecas La Junta Del Sol Y Cruz.

<P>Why are his trousers vermilion?
<BR>Why does he claim he's Castilian?
<BR>Why do his friends call him "Lillian?"
<BR>And I hear at the end of the week,
<BR>He's leaving to start a boutique.

<P>Though I smile, I'm only pretending,
<BR>'Cause I know today's the last I'll be spending,
<BR>With the boy from Tacarembo La Tumbe Del Fuego Santa Malipas Zatatecas La Junta Del Sol Y Cruz.
<BR>Tomorrow he sails.
<BR>He's moving to Wales.
<BR>To live in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobullllandysiliogogogoch.
