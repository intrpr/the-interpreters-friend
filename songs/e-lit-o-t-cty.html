<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In this house we've built of make believe
<BR>Loved ones go long before seems it's time to leave
<BR>But we will learn how to grieve, to forgive and receive
<BR>'Til we see them there in that city
 
<P>2. Spans of stars over head as we walk this road
<BR>While this darkness remains I will bear your load 
<BR>And together we will tend the seed He's sown
<BR>As we walk along the road to that city

<P>3. On that day we will sing "Holy, Holy"
<BR>On that day we'll bow down in the light
<BR>And then we'll rise and turn our eyes
<BR>To the One who's the light, the light of that city

<P>4. Though my eyes can't see what is waiting there
<BR>Though my mind can't conceive all that He's prepared
<BR>There the blind will see the sun
<BR>What was old will be young
<BR>And the lame, they will run all over the streets of that City

<P>5. On that day we will sing "Holy, Holy"
<BR>On that day we'll bow down in the light
<BR>And then we'll rise and turn our eyes
<BR>To the Lord, Jesus Christ
 
<P>6. On that day we will sing, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy"
<BR>On that day we'll rise and turn our eyes
<BR>To the Lord, Jesus Christ
<BR>He's the light of that City
