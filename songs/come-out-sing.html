<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> This piece starts with some parts sung only by the women and some parts sung only by the men, until the voices join together symbolically. The interpreter should spatialize who is singing to whom by showing which side of the group is signing if one is on stage left and one on stage right or simply spatializing them arbitrarily.

<P>#ALL-OF-YOU - [A], PO up, FO > DS - held at DS then swings away in an arc and ends [L^], PO up, FO > NDS.

<P>OPEN-HEARTED - (2h)[B], POs > signer, FOs touching, cover heart and then swing upon.

<P>OPEN-MINDED - (2h)[B], POs > signer, FOs touching, cover forehead and then swing upon.

<P>(2h)"WOW" - (2h)[5] shake out hands

<P>GROUP-TOGETHER - (2h)[C}, POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are brought together as if pushing people/things together into a group.

<P>TOP-PRIORITY - DH palm strikes thumb of [5], PO > DS, FO away. 

<P>STEP-BY-STEP - (2h)[B^], FOs > opposite sides, leap frog ov er one another.

<P>PERSPECTIVE - [V] "looks" at both sides of [1], PO > DS, FO up. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/perspective.swf">ASL Pro: Perspective.</A>

<P>NO-NO - a [1], PO away, FO up, - shaken side to side.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>GROUP'big' - Same sign as GROUP but make the arcs large. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>JOIN-us - Like JOIN but the DH - inserted from the other side of the NDH.

<P>TAKE-A-STAND - Like the sign STAND but it - done emphatically.

<P>CAN'T-NOT - The reversal of the sign CAN'T where the DH moves up and strikes the NDH FT instead of down.
