<P><B>Refrain:</B> Save us, O Lord; carry us back. Rouse your power and come. Rescue your people; show us your face. Bring us back. 

<P>1. O Shepherd of Israel, hear us. Return and we shall be saved. Arise, O Lord; hear our cries, O Lord: bring us back!

<P>2. How long will you hide from your people? We long to see your face. Give ear to us. Draw near to us, Lord God of hosts!

<P>3. Turn again; care for your vine; protect what your right hand has planted. Your vineyards are trampled, uprooted, and burned. Come to us, Father of might!
