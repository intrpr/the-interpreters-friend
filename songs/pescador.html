<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U>-lf - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. I have also spatialized this on the left because that is where I place Jesus, as opposed to the Father.

<P>SHORE - NDH [Bb], PO down, FO away, acts as the shore line, and the DH [5], PO down, FO > NDS, wg while moving towards and spilling over onto the dorsal side (backhand) of the NDH, receding and spilling over again, like waves. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>SOFT-HEARTED - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^] but hands close to heart.

<P>alt.SHOOT-GUNS - (2h)[L], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move in alt. circles orthogonal (perpendicular) to the chest.

<P>NET - DH [4], PO > signer, FO up, draws lines down NDH [5], PO > signer, FO > DS.

<P>THAT'S-#ALL - [A] strikes palm against palm of NDH [B], DH changes to [L] and moves away while remaining in contact with palm. 

<P>TAKE-CARE-OF - (2h)[K], FOs away, cross at wrist and circle perpendicular to chest.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>GATHER - [5:], PO down, FO away, scrapes material into palm of upturned [B] while sweeping > NDS.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>LOVING - LOVE is repeated close to the body. 
  
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lord, you have come to the lakeshore 
<BR>looking neither for wealthy nor wise ones. 
<BR>You only asked me to follow humbly.	

<P><B>Refrain:</B> O Lord, with your eyes you have searched me, 
<BR>kindly smiling, have spoken my name. 
<BR>Now my boat's left on the shoreline behind me; 
<BR>by your side I will seek other seas. 	     

<P>2. You know so well my possessions; 
<BR>my boat carries no gold and no weapons;
<BR>But nets and fishes -- my daily labor. 	

<P>3. You need my hands, full of caring, 
<BR>through my labors to give others rest,
<BR>and constant love that keeps on loving. 	

<P>4. You, who have fished other oceans 
<BR>ever longed-for by souls who are waiting,
<BR>my loving friend, as thus you call me. 

<P>1. T&uacute; has venido a la orilla, 
<BR>no has buscado ni a sabios ni a ricos; 
<BR>tan s&oacute;lo quieres que yo te siga.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Se&ntilde;or, me has mirado a lost ojos, 
<BR>sonriendo has dicho mi nombre, 
<BR>en la arena he djado mi barca, 
<BR>junto a ti buscar&eacute; otro mar.

<P>2. T&uacute; sabes bien lo que tengo; 
<BR>en mi braca no hay oro ni espadas, 
<BR>tan s&oacute;lo redes y mi trabajo.

<P>3. T&uacute; necesitas mis manos, 
<BR>mi cansancio que a otros descanse, 
<BR>amor que quiera seguir, amando.

<P>4. T&uacute;, pescador de otros lagos, 
<BR>ansia eterna de almas que esperan, 
<BR>amigo bueno, que as&iacute; me llamas.
