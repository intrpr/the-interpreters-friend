<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> For I have come not to be served but to serve; 
<BR>To give my life. 
<BR>If you wish to be the first you must seek
<BR>To be a servant, to be a servant.

<P>1. Can you drink the cup that I must drink;
<BR>Are you willing?
<BR>Can you be baptized like I have been baptized?
<BR>Are you able? Are you able?

<P>2. For to sit at my right hand or at my left,
<BR>Is not for me to give.
<BR>But for those for whom it has been prepared,
<BR>It will be given. It will be given.
