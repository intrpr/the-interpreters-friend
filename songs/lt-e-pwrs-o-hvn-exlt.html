<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>||: Let the powers of heaven exult! Let choirs of angels dance for joy! Let all creation raise its song of praise! Jesus Christ is risen! :|| Let the trumpet of salvation resound for such a victory! ||: Jesus Christ is risen! :|| Let the earth be glad, let it shine with beauty, radiant as the moon before dawn. Christ triumphant shines in glory! Darkness dispersed forevermore! Jesus Christ is risen! Jesus Christ is risen! Rejoice Mother Church, robed about in holy splendor! The risen Savior shines the light of day upon you! Jesus Christ is risen! Jesus Christ is risen! Let the sacred walls resound, echoing the mighty sound, the voice of all God's chose ones! Jesus Christ is risen! Jesus Christ is risen! 

<P>(Spoken) And so my dear sisters and brothers standing by, pray with me as we gather in the marvelous brilliance of this flame. Call upon the Most High God to grant mercy to this/these minister(s) before you, (one unworthy of this task.) Pour forth the brightness of this fire upon the singer of the candle's praises at this festival of spring, through our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns in the oneness of the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Response Amen. The Lord be with you. Response And also with you. (Sung) Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right to give thanks and praise to God. Truly it is fitting and just that with hearts and minds full of joy we fill this church with the resounding song of praise to the unseen God, to the Most High God and to the Holy and Blessed One, our Lord Jesus Christ; who for us smashed the chains of the ancient wrong by the flowing stream of his sacred blood, and gladly paid the price, wiping away the sin of Adam. For this is the Passover feast in which the true Lamb was killed, whose blood made holy the doorposts of the faithful. 

<P>This is the night you revived your people Israel. You rescued them, guiding your children safely through the waters of the Red Sea. This is the night, which purged the gloom of sin by a blazing pillar of Light. ||: This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! :|| This is the night that all believers in Christ, drawn from the deep darkness of sin and severed from the vices of the world, are delivered up to grace and wed to holiness. This is the night when Christ arose victorious from the grave, destroying the prison walls of death. ||: This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! :|| Truly we are born in vain unless we gained redemption. O how wonderful your tender mercy that surrounds us! O gift of love beyond all telling! To redeem a slave, you handed over your Son, the Beloved. truly necessary the sin of Adam destroyed by the death of Christ. O blessed fall from grace which gained for us a Savior. O most blessed night which alone deserved to know the very hour of Christ's rising from the tomb. ||: This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! :|| Therefore this blessed night scatters evil, washes sins away, restores the integrity to the fallen, and gives back joy to those in sorrow. Let it put hatred to flight! Let it make pride and tyranny bend low! Let it give birth to true union of hearts! This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! 

<P>Therefore, by the grace of this night, receive, O holy God, the evening offering of this flame which your Church returns to you by the solemn gift of this Easter Candle from the hands of your minister(s) and the work of tiny bees! This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! So now we raise a brand new canticle proclaiming this Easter Light whose fire burns brightly to the honor and glory of God. For recall: many paths to follow, many illusions to seek, many lost straying in the darkness, but your wandering people are drawn to the Holy Candle, whose wax the mother bee brought forth into the heart of this most precious Light! This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! O truly blessed night which exalted your people and crushed their enemies! O night when earth is joined with heaven and the human is wed to the Divine! Let us pray to you, O God, that this very Candle, consecrated to the honor of your Name, destroy the power of darkness with its steadfast flame! This is the night the Light broke the chains of death. O holy night! O night of glory! May the true Bearer of Light, the Morning Star, ever bright, find this flame ever blazing, the Christ, that true Morning Star, which knows no setting: that Light, which having risen from the grave, shines joyfully, shines joyfully on all who live and breath. Amen! (6x)
