<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?

<P>1. All who see me insult me, shake their heads: "He put trust in the Lord, let's see if God rescues him, if he is God's friend."

<P>2. Evil ones, they surround me like angry dogs. They press around me and stare. They pierce my hands, wound my feet, number all my bones.

<P>3. They divide up my garments, casting lots. Do not leave me, O Lord. Oh, be my strength, God I pray, quickly come to me.

<P>4. I will speak of your name for all my days. Jacob's family, sing praise. Oh, fear the Lord, praise the Lord, House of Israel.
