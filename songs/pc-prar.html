<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 
<BR>Where there's hatred grown, let me sow Your love. 
<BR>Where there's injury, Lord, let forgiveness be my sword. 
<BR>Lord,make me a means of Your peace. 

<P>2. Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 
<BR>Where there's doubt and fear, let me sow Your faith. 
<BR>In this world's despair, give me hope in You to share. 
<BR>Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 

<P>3. Lord, make me a means of your peace. 
<BR>When there's sadness here, let me sow Your joy. 
<BR>When the darkness nears, may Your light dispel our fears. 
<BR>Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 

<P>4. Lord, grant me to seek and to share: 
<BR>less to be consoled than to help console, 
<BR>less be understood than to understand your good. 
<BR>Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 

<P>5. Lord, grant me to seek and to share: 
<BR>to receive love less than to give love free, 
<BR>just to give in Thee, just receiving from Your tree. 
<BR>Lord, make me a means of Your peace. 

<P>6. Lord, grant me to seek and to share: 
<BR>to forgive in Thee, You've forgive me; 
<BR>for to die in Thee is eternal life to me. 
<BR>Lord, make me a means of Your peace.
