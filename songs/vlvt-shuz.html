<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Let us walk in the white snow
<BR>In a soundless space;
<BR>With footsteps quiet and slow,
<BR>At a tranquil pace,
<BR>Under veils of white lace.

<P>I shall go shod in silk,
<BR>And you in wool,
<BR>White as a white cow's milk
<BR>More beautiful
<BR>Than the breast of a gull.

<P>We shall walk through the still town
<BR>In a windless peace;
<BR>We shall step upon white down,
<BR>Upon silver fleece,
<BR>Upon softer than these.

<P>We shall walk in velvet shoes:
<BR>Wherever we go
<BR>Silence will fall like dew
<BR>On white silence below.
<BR>We shall walk on the snow.
