<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>It only takes a spark to get a fire going,
<BR>And soon all those around can warm up in its glowing;
<BR>That's how it is with God's Love,
<BR>Once you've experienced it,
<BR>Your spread the love to everyone
<BR>You want to pass it on.

<P>What a wonderous time is spring,
<BR>When all the tress are budding
<BR>The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming;
<BR>That's how it is with God's love,
<BR>Once you've experienced it.
<BR>You want to sing, it's fresh like spring,
<BR>You want to pass it on.

<P>I wish for you my friend
<BR>This happiness that I've found;
<BR>You can depend on God
<BR>It matters not where you're bound,
<BR>I'll shout it from the mountain top - PRAISE GOD!
<BR>I want the world to know
<BR>The Lord of love has come to me
<BR>I want to pass it on.

<P>I'll shout it from the mountain top - PRAISE GOD!
<BR>I want the world to know
<BR>The Lord of love has come to me
<BR>I want to pass it on.
