<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: We hold the death of the Lord deep in our hearts. Living, now we remain with Jesus, the Christ.

<P>1. Once we were people afraid, lost in the night. Then by your cross we were saved. Dead became living, life from your giving.

<P>2. Something which we have known, something we've touched, what we have seen with our eyes: this we have heard, life giving Word.

<P>3. He chose to give of himself, became our bread. Broken that we might live. Love beyond love, pain for our pain.

<P>4. We are in the presence of God. This is our call. Now to become bread and wine: food for the hungry, life for the weary, for to live with the Lord, we must die with the Lord.
