<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water? 
<BR>Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters? 
<BR>Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new? 
<BR>This child that you delivered will soon deliver you. 

<P>2. Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to the blind man? 
<BR>Mary did you know that your baby boy would calm a storm with his hand? 
<BR>Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod, 
<BR>and when you kiss your little baby, you've kissed the face of God? 

<P><B>Coda:</B> Mary did you know? Mary did you know? 
<BR>The blind will see and the deaf will hear. 
<BR>The dead will live again. The lame will leap,
<BR>the dumb will speak the praises of the Lamb.

<P>3. Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation? 
<BR>Mary did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations? 
<BR>Did you know that your baby boy was heaven's perfect Lamb,
