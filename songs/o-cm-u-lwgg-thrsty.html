<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O come, you longing thirsty souls, drink freely from the spring.
<BR>And come, you weary famished folk, and end your hungering.
<BR>Why spend yourself on empty air? Why not be satisfied?
<BR>For everywhere a feast is spread that's always at our side.

<P>2. For as the rain and snow above fall not in vanity,
<BR>But for this purpose water earth: to feed humanity.
<BR>So shall the word of spirit serve as seed within our loam,
<BR>That we may bear so rich a yield as brings the harvest home.

<P>3. For we shall go in peace secure and leave in joy sublime!
<BR>The hills outside will burst with song, the trees will clap in time!
<BR>No more shall thorns and nettles grow! The bay tree and the pine,
<BR>Shall sign for us th'eternal name that makes the world a shrine.
