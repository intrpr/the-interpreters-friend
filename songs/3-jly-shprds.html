<!--1. As I rode out this enders night,
Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight,
And all about their fold a star shone bright:
ÊÊÊ They sang terly terlow;
ÊÊÊ So merrily the shepherds their pipes gan blow.

2. Down from heaven, from heaven so high,
Of angels there came a great company,
With mirth and joy and great solemnity,
ÊÊÊ They sang terly terlow;
ÊÊÊ So merrily the shepherds their pipes gan blow.-->
