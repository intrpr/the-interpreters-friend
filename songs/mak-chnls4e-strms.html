<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Make channels for the streams of love
<BR>Where they may safely run;
<BR>And love has overflowing streams
<BR>To fill them every one.

<P>2. But if at any time we cease
<BR>Such channels to provide
<BR>The very founts of love for us
<BR>Will soon be parched and dried.

<P>3. For we must share, if we would keep
<BR>This gift all else above;
<BR>Ceasing to give we cease to have-
<BR>Such is the law of love.
