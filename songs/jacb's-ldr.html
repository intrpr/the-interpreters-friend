<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>CLIMB-LADDER - Hands mime grabbing onto successive rungs of a ladder.

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder. 

<P>LEAD-TO - LEAD moves up to "Heaven" not straight forward as usual.

<P>ADVANCED+ - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer, and then arc up again even higher.  For an animated gif of the sign this is based on, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>
