<P>Gooses, geeses, I want to lay gold eggs for Easter! At least a hundred a day! And by the way... I want a feast. I want a bean-feast. Cream buns and doughnuts and fruit cake with no nuts, so good you could go nuts. I want a ball. I want a party. Pink macaroons and a million balloons and performing baboons and give it to me now! I want the world. I want the whole world. I want to lock it all up in my pocket. It's my bar of choc'late. Give it to me now. I want today, I want tomorrow, I want to wear 'em like braids in my hair and I don't want to share 'em! I want a party with roomfuls of laughter. Ten thousand tons of ice cream. And if I don't get the things I am after, I'm going to scream. I want the works! I want the whole works. Presents and prizes and sweets and surprises of all shapes and sizes and now. Don't care how, I want it now. Don't care how, I want it now!
