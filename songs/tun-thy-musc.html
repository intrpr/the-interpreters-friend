<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> In this translation I try to follow the meter of the original: alternating iambic quadrimeter and iambic pentameter. For that reason I sometimes have inverted the line order, but not by more than one line. 

<P>GIVE-IN - [B], FO > NDS, puts palm on chest and slowly brings it forward and down so that it supinates (PO up) and the tongue is clucked once.

<P>CONVERSE-WITH-God - COVERSATION with eyes up to God.

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>GUT - Tap side with [B^], PO > signer, FO down.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>SHOW-SELF - Mime opening shirt as if baring the chest and one's inmost secrets. 

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist. 

<P>CONQUER - (2h)[S], DPO > NDS, NDPO down, FOs away, are held with DH on top of NDH and DH strikes NDH at wrist while index and middle fingers shoot out suddenly. 

<P>BLOCK - PREVENT.

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>SUPREME - (2h)[A], FOs away, DH starts below NDH and arcs around it until it is on top.

<P>RISE-TO-HEAVEN - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, hands rise with wg.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Original English:</B> 

<P>Tune thy Musicke to thy hart,
<BR>Sing thy ioy with thankes, and so thy sorrow:
<BR>Though Devotion needes not Art,
<BR>Sometimes of the poore the rich may borrow.

<P>Striue not yet for curious wayes:
<BR>Concord pleaseth more, the lesse 'tis strained;
<BR>Zeale affects not outward prayse,
<BR>Onely striues to show a loue vnfained.

<P>Loue can wondrous things affect,
<BR>Sweetest Sacrifice, all wrath appeasing;                     
<BR>Loue the highest doth respect;
<BR>Loue alone to him is euer pleasing.

<P><B>Modernized English:</B>

<P>Tune your music to your heart, 
<BR>Sing your joy with thanks and so your sorrow.
<BR>Though devotion need not art, 
<BR>Sometimes of the poor the rich may borrow. 

<P>Strive not yet for curious ways: 
<BR>Concord pleases more, the less it's strained.
<BR>Zeal affects not outward praise, 
<BR>Only strives to show a love unfeigned.

<P>Love can wondrous things affect, 
<BR>Sweetest sacrifice all wrath appeasing. 
<BR>Love the Highest does respect; 
<BR>Love alone to Him is ever pleasing,
