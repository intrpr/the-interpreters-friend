<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
<BR>And my spirit exults in God my Savior. 
<BR>For He has looked with mercy on my lowliness, 
<BR>And my name will be forever exalted.
<BR>For the mighty God has done great things for me,
<BR>And His mercy will reach from age to age, 
<BR>And holy, holy, holy is His name. 

<P>2. He has mercy in ev'ry generation, 
<BR>He has revealed His power and His glory.
<BR>He has cast down the mighty in their arrogance, 
<BR>And has lifted up the meek and the lowly.
<BR>He has come to help His servant Israel; 
<BR>He remembers His promise to our fathers,
<BR>And holy, holy, holy is His name.
