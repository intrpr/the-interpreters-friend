<P>CRASH-SHORE - (2h)[B], NDH PO down, FO > DS, is held still and DH smacks against it and moves up with wg to show waves crashing on the rocks.

<P>alt.HIT-CHIN - with fists.

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>When you're weary, feeling small,
<BR>When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all;
<BR>I'm on your side. When times get rough
<BR>And friends just can't be found,

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: Like a bridge over troubled water
<BR>I will lay me down. :||

<P>When you're down and out,
<BR>When you're on the street,
<BR>When evening falls so hard
<BR>I will comfort you.
<BR>I'll take your part.
<BR>When darkness comes
<BR>And pain is all around, <B>Refrain</B>

<P>Sail on silvergirl,
<BR>Sail on by.
<BR>Your time has come to shine.
<BR>All your dreams are on their way.
<BR>See how they shine
<BR>If you need a friend
<BR>I'm sailing right behind. <B>Refrain</B>
