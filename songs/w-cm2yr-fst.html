<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. We place upon Your table a gleaming cloth of white
<BR>The weaving of our stories, the fabric of our lives,
<BR>The dreams of those before us, the ancient hopeful cries,
<BR>The promise of our future, our needing and our nurture
<BR>Lie here before our lives.

<P><P><B>Refrain:</B> We come to Your feast, we come to your feast,
<BR>the young and the old, the frightened ,the bold, 
<BR>the greatest and the least.
<BR>We come to your Feast, we come to your Feast,
<BR>with the fruit of our lands and the work of our hands
<BR>we come to your feast

<P>2. We place upon Your table a humble loaf of bread,
<BR>The gift of field and hillside, the grain by which we're fed,
<BR>We come to taste the presence, of him whom we feed,
<BR>To strengthen and connect us, to challenge and correct us,
<BR>To love in word and deed. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. We place upon Your Table a simple cup of wine,
<BR>The fruit of human labour, the gift of sun and vine
<BR>We come taste the presence of him we claim as Lord
<BR>His dying and his living, his leading and his giving,
<BR>his love in cup outpour. <B>Refrain</B>
