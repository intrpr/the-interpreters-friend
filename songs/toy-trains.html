<P>Little toy trains, little toy tracks
<BR>Little toy drums, comin' from a sack
<BR>Carried by a man dressed in white and red
<BR>Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed
<BR>Close your eye-eye-eye-eyes
<BR>Listen to the sky-y-y-y-y-ies

<P>All is calm, all is well
<BR>Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the ji-ingle bells
<BR>Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
<BR>Little toy drums, comin' from a sack

<P>Carried by a man dressed in white and red
<BR>Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed...
<BR>So close your eye-eye-eye-eyes
<BR>And listen to the sky-y-y-y-y-ies

<P>All is calm, all is well
<BR>Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the ji-ingle bells
<BR>Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
<BR>Little toy drums, comin' from a sack
<BR>Carried by a man dressed in white and red
<BR>Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed
<BR>Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed
