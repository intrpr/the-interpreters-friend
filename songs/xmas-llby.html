<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Are you far away from home this dark and lonely night? 
<BR>Tell me what best would help to ease your mind: 
<BR>Someone to give direction for this unfamiliar road 
<BR>Or one who says, "Follow Me and I will lead you home"? 

<P>2. How beautiful, how precious the Savior of old, 
<BR>To love so completely the loneliest soul. 
<BR>How gently, how tenderly He says to one and all, 
<BR>"Child, you can follow Me and I will lead you home. 
<BR>Trust Me and follow Me, and I will lead you home. 

<P>3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay 
<BR>Close by me forever, and love me, I pray. 
<BR>Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care, 
<BR>And take them to heaven to live with Thee there.
