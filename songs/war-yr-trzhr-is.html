<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Where your treasure is, there your heart shall be.
<BR>All that you possess will never set you free.
<BR>See the things that last; Come and learn from me.
<BR>Where your treasure is your heart shall be.

<P>1. What do you gain from all your worry,
<BR>What you should eat or what to wear?
<BR>There is no peace in stress or hurry. 
<BR>Do you not know that your are held within God’s care?

<P>2. Look at the ravens high above you.
<BR>They do not work their whole life through,
<BR>And yet God feeds them and protects them 
<BR>So how much more will God protect and care for you?

<P>3. Behold the lilies in their splendor.
<BR>In grace and beauty are they dressed,
<BR>And yet so soon their bloom is faded.
<BR>So how much more will those who look to God be blessed?

<P><B>Coda/Bridge</B>: Do not fear, little flock, for God delights 
<BR>to give you the blessed reign of God.
<BR>Give your possessions to the needy;
<BR>Gain a treasure that will not fade.

<P><B>Refrain</B> (repeat last line: Where your treasure is your heart shall be.)
