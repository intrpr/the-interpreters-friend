<!--5. Into the desert I was led,
Where I fasted without substance;
The Devil bade me make stones my bread,
To have me break my true love's dance. 

6. The Jews on me they made great suit,
And with me made great variance,
Because they loved darkness rather than light,
To call my true love to my dance. 

7. For thirty pence Judas me sold,
His covetousness for to advance:
Mark whom I kiss, the same do hold!
The same is he shall lead the dance. 

8. Before Pilate the Jews me brought,
Where Barabbas had deliverance;
They scourged me and set me at nought,
Judged me to die to lead the dance. 

9. Then on the cross hanged I was,
Where a spear my heart did glance;
There issued forth both water and blood,
To call my true love to my dance. 

10. Then down to hell I took my way
For my true love's deliverance,
And rose again on the third day,
Up to my true love and the dance. 

11. Then up to heaven I did ascend,
Where now I dwell in sure substance
On the right hand of God, that man
May come unto the general dance.--> 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> I was truly take aback when I had to translate this carol. Jesus is saying that tomorrow will be his dancing day?! On a recording by <I>The Valley Folk</I> on their LP <I>All Bells in Paradise</I> Topic 12 T 192 [1968], A.L. Lloyd on the record sleeve says as follows: "By some happy accident, a secular love song and a religious poem came together and got jumbled up. The result is one of our most surprising and beautiful carols." I have tried to make sense of this by translating it in such a way that Jesus could have siad this. <A HREF="http://drcurmudgeon.blogspot.com/2004/12/christmas-carol-at-beginning-of.html">Dr. Curmudgeon</A> says, "A carol, which really should go on the 24th as well, 'Tomorrow Shall Be my Dancing Day'. This carol was first published in 1833 but is far older than that. Scholars believe it dates back to the medieval Cornish mystery plays presented during the Christmas season. The tune is lovely but it's the imagery of man as the true and eternally wooed love of Christ that makes this carol."

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Tomorrow shall be my dancing day: 
<BR>I would my true love did so chance
<BR>To see the legend of my play,
<BR>To call my true love to my dance:

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Sing O my love, O my love, my love, my love;
<BR>This have I done for my true love. 

<P>2. Then was I born of a virgin pure,
<BR>Of her I took fleshly substance;
<BR>Thus was I knit to man's nature, 
<BR>To call my true love to my dance:

<P>3. In a manger laid and wrapped I was,
<BR>So very poor this was my chance,
<BR>Betwixt an ox and a silly poor ass, 
<BR>To call my true love to my dance:

<P>4. Then afterwards baptized I was;
<BR>The Holy Ghost on me did glance,
<BR>My Father's voice heard from above,
<BR>To call my true love to my dance: 

<!--<P>5. Into the desert I was led,
<BR>Where I fasted without substance;
<BR>The Devil bade me make stones my bread,
<BR>To have me break my true love's dance. 

<P>6. The Jews on me they made great suit,
<BR>And with me made great variance,
<BR>Because they loved darkness rather than light,
<BR>To call my true love to my dance. 

<P>7. For thirty pence Judas me sold,
<BR>His covetousness for to advance:
<BR>Mark whom I kiss, the same do hold!
<BR>The same is he shall lead the dance. 

<P>8. Before Pilate the Jews me brought,
<BR>Where Barabbas had deliverance;
<BR>They scourged me and set me at nought,
<BR>Judged me to die to lead the dance. 

<P>9. Then on the cross hanged I was,
<BR>Where a spear my heart did glance;
<BR>There issued forth both water and blood,
<BR>To call my true love to my dance. 

<P>10. Then down to hell I took my way
<BR>For my true love's deliverance,
<BR>And rose again on the third day,
<BR>Up to my true love and the dance. 

<P>11. Then up to heaven I did ascend,
<BR>Where now I dwell in sure substance
<BR>On the right hand of God, that man
<BR>May come unto the general dance.-->
