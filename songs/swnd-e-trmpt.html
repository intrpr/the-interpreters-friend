<P>||: GO-AHEAD BLOW-INTO-HORN. :|| 

<P>||: SOUND SPREADwg. :||

<P>SOUND ARRIVE FAR-AWAY SHORE.

<P>PEOPLE JOIN DIFFERENT WAY.

<P>(&lt;) SOME VIOLIN,  (>) SOME CELLO.  

<P>(&lt;) SOME TRUMPET,  (>) SOME TROMBONE.  

<P>(&lt;) SOME DRUM,  (>) SOME TAMBOURINE.  

<P>(&lt;) SOME FLUTE,  (>) SOME CLARINET.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.

<P>BLOW-INTO-HORN - (2h)[S] held one in front of the other at the mouth like sounding a horn. 

<P>SHORE - NDH [Bb] is the shore and [5wg] moves towards and awy from shore striking it like waater waves. 

<P>For the musical instruments (VIOLIN - GLOCKENSPIEL), mime playing them.  A glockenspiel is played by holding the base, which is a vertical rod in the NDH fist and the  vertical keys (which look like those on a xylophone) are struck with a mallot, DH [S].    

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Sound the trumpet, sound the trumpet, sound the trumpet!
<BR>Sound, sound, sound the trumpet till around
<BR>You make the list'ning shores rebound.
<BR>On the sprightly hautboy play
<BR>All the instruments of joy
<BR>That skillful numbers can employ,
<BR>To celebrate the glories of this day.
