<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Remember your love and your faithfulness, O Lord.
<BR>Remember your people and have mercy on us, Lord

<P>1. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear?
<BR>The Lord is my life and my refuge; when I call He hears. 

<P>2. If you dwelt, O Lord, upon our sinfulness, then who could stand?
<BR>But with You there is mercy and forgiveness and a guiding hand. 

<P>3. O Lord, hear the sound of my call and answer me.
<BR>My heart cries out for Your presence; it is You I seek. 
 
<P>4. As sentinels wait upon the daylight, wait for the Lord. 
<BR>I trust in your kindness and redemption; and your faithful word.

<P>5. Before all the mountains were begotten and earth took shape, 
<BR>even then, O Lord, you were our refuge throughout every age.
