<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>'Twas in the moon of wintertime, when all the birds had fled, that mighty Gitchi Manitou sent angel choirs instead. Before their light the stars are dim and wondering hunters hear the hymn:

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Jesus, your King is born. Jesus your King is born. In excelsis gloria.

<P>Within a lodge of broken bark, the tender Babe was found; a ragged robe of rabbit skin enwrapped his beauty round. The chiefs from far, before Him knelt with gifts of fox and beaver pelt. 

<P>O children of the forest free, O you of Manitou, the Holy Child of earth and heaven is born today for you. Come kneel before the radiant boy who brings you beauty, peace, and joy.
