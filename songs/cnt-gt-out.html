<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P>NURTURE~(2h)YOU - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature, followed immediately by spreading the hands to the side.  

<P>A-TO-Z - [A], PO away, FO up, is held on NDS of NDH [5], PO > signer, FO up, and then the DH moves over NDH FT and traces a "Z" on the DS of the NDH.

<P>HELP-'you all' - HELP swept from NDS to DS to indicate helping everyone.
