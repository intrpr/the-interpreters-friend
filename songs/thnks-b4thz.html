<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Thanks be for these, life's holy times, 
<BR>moments of grief, days of delight; 
<BR>triumph and failure intertwine, 
<BR>shaping our vision of the right.

<P>Thanks be for these, for birth and death; 
<BR>life in between with meaning full; 
<BR>holy becomes the quickened breath; 
<BR>we celebrate life's interval.

<P>Thanks be for these, ennobling art, 
<BR>images welcome to our sight; 
<BR>Music caressing ear and heart, 
<BR>inviting us to loftier height.
