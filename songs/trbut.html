<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> (2h)"HEY" - (2h)[B] wave to get attention. Looks like the sign CHILDREN, but hands are held higher. 

<P>FRIENDS - (2h)[X] are interlinked and move in a horizontal circle.

<P>CLOSER-AND-CLOSER - Like the sign ARRIVE, but the DH moves towards the NDH in small steps, pausing each time.  

<P>PART-WAYS - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, are held side by side and move forward, splitting as each handverves off to its respective side.

<P>(2h)SAY-FAREWELL - (2h)[B], touch palms to chin and supinate (flip over) separating while moving slightly up and down, like the sign CHILDREN, but held higher. 

<P>RIGHT-NOW - NOW is signed with a slight double movement and with the non-manual <U>cs</U> as in the sign RECENT.

<P>TAKE-ADVANTAGE - DH [5], PO > NDS, FO away, swoops down and grabs something from the upturned NDH [B] palm, and then shoots upward.
 
<P>GATHER - (2h)[S], POs down, FOs >&lt;, move > each other while opening to (2h)[5wg]. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>HOLD-HIGH - [C] holds an imaginary glass up high. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>Oh friends, the crossroads are near. 
<BR>Soon we will say to each other another farewell. 
<BR>So let's live for the moment. 
<BR>Sing one more song of elation, 
<BR>one more glass of good cheer. 
<BR>Though the chapter shall end, when we turn the page, 
<BR>let us sing a tribute to life as friends. 

<P>My friends, take pride in our years. 
<BR>We've borne the seeds of tradition with friends gathered here. 
<BR>Let's raise our glasses high. 
<BR>Let's toast in honor of memories in thanks for the times. 
<BR>Though the chapter shall end when we turn the page, 
<BR>the end of this night is the end of our age, 
<BR>we all set forth to find our own way. 
<BR>Let us sing a tribute to life as friends, as friends.
