<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
<BR>Calling for you and for me;
<BR>See, on the portals He’s waiting and watching,
<BR>Watching for you and for me.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Come home, come home,
<BR>You who are weary, come home;
<BR>Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
<BR>Calling, O sinner, come home!

<P>2. Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
<BR>Pleading for you and for me?
<BR>Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
<BR>Mercies for you and for me?

<P>3. Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
<BR>Passing from you and from me;
<BR>Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
<BR>Coming for you and for me.

<P>4. O for the wonderful love He has promised,
<BR>Promised for you and for me!
<BR>Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,
<BR>Pardon for you and for me.
