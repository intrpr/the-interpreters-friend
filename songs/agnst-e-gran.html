<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We have seen and we have been told, 
<BR>and our ways are passed to young from old. 
<BR>He was born and suffered through the pain, 
<BR>and he rose to move against the grain. <B>Refrain</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> No more sorrow, no more pain, 
<BR>cease your silence, come O rain.

<P>2. When we see the torment in the fields, 
<BR>when we hear the battle cry of the children, 
<BR>do we sit and close our eyes to their pain, 
<BR>or do we stand and move against the grain? <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. Come O rain and wash the blood from the earth. 
<BR>Come O rain and bring us to a new birth. 
<BR>As he died to give us life again, 
<BR>we shall rise and move against the grain.

<P>4. And his word we carry as our shield, 
<BR>and his love will shelter us forever. 
<BR>As he lived, will we be no less the same 
<BR>when we rise and move against the grain. <B>Refrain</B>
