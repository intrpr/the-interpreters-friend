<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Long before the mountains came to be 
<BR>And the land and sea and stars of the night,
<BR>Through the endless seasons of all time,
<BR>You have always been,
<BR>You will always be.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> In every age, 
<BR>You have been our refuge.
<BR>In every age, 
<BR>You have been our hope.

<P>2. Destiny is cast, and at your silent word
<BR>We return to dust and scatter to the wind.
<BR>A thousand years are like a single moment gone,
<BR>As the light that fades
<BR>at the end of day. 

<P>3. Teach us to make use of the time we have,
<BR>Teach us to be patient even as we wait.
<BR>Teach us to embrace our every joy and pain.
<BR>To sleep peacefully,
<BR>and to rise up strong.
