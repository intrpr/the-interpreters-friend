<P>GIFT-TO-me - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands tip back towards signer to show that something is given as a gift. 

<P>TAKE-OFF - Like DEVELOP but moves quickly and abruptly with a "po". 

<P>WINGS - Second half of ANGEL: arms extended and bent move slightly as if flying gently.

<P>(1h)SOAR - Because the end of the sentence is held so long, it would look strange to strecth out the sing WINGS. To remedy this, add DH [Bb], PO diagonally down, FO away, moves diagonally upwards, slowly and in a wavy pattern as if soaring.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>MIRACLE - WONDERFUL(1x) WORK. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=43">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Miracle.</A>

<P>(2h)VERY-LONG-AGO - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, circle as they move back over the shoulder. 

<P>TOO-MUCH - (2h)[B^], touch FTs, then DH moves up in an arc towards the signer and away. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/M/W2393.htm">ASL browser - more than</A>. 

<P>REJECT - Hands start like the final position of STOP and DH slides > DS while pronating.

<P>SIT THRONE -  - SIT + (2h)[B:], POs down, FOs away, behave as if they were on the arms of a throne. 

<P>LEAVE-ALONE - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, descend in the place where the person or thing is left.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: All that I am sings of the God who brings  
new life to birth in me. My spirit soars on the wings of my Lord.

<P>1. My soul gives glory to the Lord, rejoicing in my saving God, who looks upon me in my state, and all the world will call me blest; For God works marvels in my sight, and holy, holy is God’s name.

<P>2. God’s mercy is from age to age, on those who 
follow in fear; Whose arm is power and strength, and scatters all the proud of heart; Who casts the mighty from their thrones and raises up the lowly ones!

<P>3. God fills the starving with good things, the rich 
are left with empty hands; Protecting all the faithful ones, remembering Israel with mercy, the promise known to those before and to their children for ever!
