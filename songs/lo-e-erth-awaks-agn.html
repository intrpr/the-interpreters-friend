<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Lo, the earth awakes again, alleluia!
<BR>From the winter's bond and pain, alleluia!
<BR>Bring we leaf and flower and spray, alleluia!
<BR>To adorn this happy day, alleluia!

<P>Once again the word comes true, alleluia!
<BR>All the earth shall be made new, alleluia!
<BR>Now the dark, cold days are o'er, alleluia!
<BR>Spring and gladness are before, alleluia!

<P>Change, then, mourning into praise, alleluia!
<BR>And, for dirges, anthems raise, alleluia!
<BR>How our spirits soar and sing, alleluia!
<BR>How our spirits leap with the spring, alleluia!
