<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ANY++ - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone".

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>PAY-OFF - [open 8] runs middle finger up palm (> wrist), changes to a [B], PO down, and then moves back across palm. 

<P>EXHAUSTED - TIRED + [V], PO up, FO > NDS, is drawn with effort across the palm of [B], PO up, FO away.

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly. 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>BURDENED - (2h)[B^] are placed on DS shoulder and press it down so that the body tips > DS.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O let all who thirst, let them come to the water.
<BR>And let all who have nothing, let them come to the Lord:
<BR>without money, without price.
<BR>Why should you pay the price, except for the Lord?

<P>2. And let all who seek, let them come to the water.
<BR>And let all who have nothing, let them come to the Lord:
<BR>without money, without strife.
<BR>Why should you spend your life, except for the Lord?

<P>3. And let all who toil, let them come to the water.
<BR>And let all who are weary, let them come to the Lord:
<BR>all who labor, without rest.
<BR>How can your soul find rest, except for the Lord?

<P>4. And let all the poor, let them come to the water.
<BR>Bring the ones who are laden, bring them all to the Lord:
<BR>bring the children without might.
<BR>Easy the load and light: come to the Lord.
