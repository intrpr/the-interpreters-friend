<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>BLOOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>PILGRIM - FT of (2h)[P] both touch sternum (midchest), then separate to sides, and then ascend to shoulders.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/P/W2889.htm">ASL browser - Pilgrim</A>. 

<P>DEW - WATER + (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, hands descend with wg and <U>hu</U>.

<P>MANY-LOOK-TO-God - (2h)[4], FOs move up to high right.

<P>GREET - Hands alt. salute from forehead, but hands are more diagonal than a military salute.

<P>LOOK-AT-EACH-OTHER - (2h)[V], FOs move from away to point to each other. 

<P>HEART-EXPAND - [O^] - held at heart PO up and FTs open and close one finger at a time but rapidly.

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O Life that makest all things new,
<BR>The blooming earth, the thoughts of men,
<BR>Our pilgrim feet, wet with Thy dew,
<BR>In gladness hither turn again.

<P>2. From hand to hand the greeting flows,
<BR>From eye to eye the signals run,
<BR>From heart to heart the bright hope glows,
<BR>The seekers of the Light are one.

<P>3. One in the freedom of the truth,
<BR>One in the joys of paths untrod,
<BR>One in the soul’s perennial youth,
<BR>One in the larger thought of God.

<P>4. The freer step, the fuller breath,
<BR>The wide horizon’s grander view,
<BR>The sense of life that knows no death,
<BR>The Life that maketh all things new!
