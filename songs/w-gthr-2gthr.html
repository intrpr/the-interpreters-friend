<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;
<BR>He chastens and hastens His will to make known.
<BR>The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.
<BR>Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.

<P>2. Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
<BR>Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
<BR>So from the beginning the fight we were winning;
<BR>Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!

<P>3. We all do extol Thee, Thou Leader triumphant,
<BR>And pray that Thou still our Defender will be.
<BR>Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;
<BR>Thy Name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
