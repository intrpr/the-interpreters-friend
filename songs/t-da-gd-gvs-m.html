<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. This day God gives me Strength of high heaven
<BR>Sun and Moon shining, Flame in my hearth
<BR>Flashing of lightning, Wind in its swiftness,
<BR>Deeps of the ocean, Firmness of earth.

<P>2. This day God sends me Strength as my guardian,
<BR>Might to uphold me, Wisdom as guide.
<BR>Your eyes are watchful, your ears are list'ning,
<BR>Your lips are speaking, Friend at my side.

<P>3. God's way is my way, God's shield is 'round me,
<BR>God's host defends me, Saving from ill.
<BR>Angels of heaven, Drive from me always
<BR>All that would harm me, Stand by me still.

<P>4. Rising I thank you, Mighty and Strong One
<BR>King of creation, Giver of rest.
<BR>Firmly confessing Threeness of Persons
<BR>Oneness of Godhead, Trinity blest.
