<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>NOT-THAT - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, wave from side to side symmetrically.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder. 

<P>ON-AND-ON - CONTINUE moving in a circle perpendicular to the chest.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>WIND-FILL-SAIL - DH [B^], PO > signer's mouth, FO up, and is supported at the elbow by the NDH palm.  Signer blows into DH palm as if wind is filling the sail.  This is actually the sign for SAIL/SAILBOAT but I have glossed it this way to help you understand how it fits into the song.

<P>(2h)5:-CL'dot sky' - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, ascend while moving forward slightly multiple times to show how the stars dot the heavens.

<P>SAIL - The same sign as above called WIND-FILL-SAIL.

<P>HEART-OPEN - (2h)[B], PO > signer, touch FTs at the heart and swing open.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>Come and let our swelling song. Mount like the whirling wind,  
<BR>As it meets our singing throng, so blithe of heart and mind.    
<BR>Care and sorrow now begone. Brothers in song, sing on!  
<BR>Brothers, sing on, sing on!    

<P>Youth is a wandering troubadour, sailing the singing breeze,  
<BR>Wooing a maid on a distant shore, over the tossing seas;    
<BR>Steering by the stars above, his vessel a song of love.  
<BR>Brothers, sing on, sing on!    

<P>Errant minstrels, thus we greet you, list to our voices strong,  
<BR>With glad and open hearts we meet you in our festival of song.    
<BR>Care and sorrow now begone. Brothers in song, sing on!  
<BR>Brothers, sing on, sing on!
