<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> MATURE - [M], PO diagonally away, FO up, slide up palm of [B], PO diagonally away, FO up. 

<P>ATTRACTED - [C], PO > NDS, FO up, is held in front of face and moves away while closing to an [S].

<P>#BACK - The [B] hand transitions to a [C] and then a [K] while moving away from signer.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards.  

<P>SUN PULL-ON-lf COMET - [C], strikes thumbside around eyesocket, then look down > left and mime pulling on a rope once, then cross (2h)[S] at wrists and move > right while DH changes to a [5wg] to show tail.

<P>alt.5:-CL - (2h)[5:], alt. descend while hands move forward to show stones in a river.

<P>FROM-NOW-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DHFT touches knuckle side of NDHFT and moves away in a downward arc.  

<P>PART - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, at first move together but shortly move diagonally > their sepective sides.

<P>LEAVE@heart - (2h)[5], strikes sides of heart with FTs.

<P>IMPRESSION - DH thumb is held against palm of [B] as in IMPRESS but moves > signer twice,.

<P>NAVIGATE - Hands held like BOAT move away in a curvy pattern.

<P>BIG-QUESTION - like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that - a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.

<P>The signs between "||:" are repeated.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason,
<BR>Bringing something we must learn.
<BR>And we are led to those who help us most to grow
<BR>If we let them and we help them in return.
<BR>Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
<BR>But I know I'm who I am today
<BR>Because I knew you...
<BR>Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun
<BR>Like a stream that meets a boulder half-way through the wood
<BR>Who can say if i've been changed for the better?
<BR>But because I knew you, I have been changed for good É
<BR>It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime
<BR>So let me say before we part
<BR>So much of me is made of what I learned from you
<BR>You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart
<BR>And now whatever way our stories end
<BR>I know you have re-written mine by being my friend...

<P>Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea
<BR>Like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distant wood
<BR>Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
<BR>But because I knew you...
<BR>Because I knew you...

<P>Because I knew you, I have been changed for good...
<BR>And just to clear the air I ask forgiveness for the things I've done you blame me for
<BR>But then, I guess we know there's blame to share
<BR>And none of it seems to matter anymore

<P>Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun
<BR>Like a stream that meets a boulder half-way through the wood
<BR>Who can say if i've been changed for the better?
<BR>I do believe I have been changed for the better
<BR>And because I knew you...
<BR>Because I knew you...
<BR>Because I knew you...
<BR>I have been changed for good.
