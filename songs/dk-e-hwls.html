<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> DECORATE - (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, alt. twist wrists while hands travel. 

<P>CONDUCT-MUSIC'la-la-la' - For the recurring refrain (fa-la-la), mime conducting music with (2h)[1], PO s down, FOs away while mouthing (fa-la-la). Don't rush the interpretation to come in exactly on time. Whenever you can make it, conduct a bit and then go to the next interpreted sentence.

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A>

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 
 
<P>DRESS-UP - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, alt. circle perpendicular to the chest with thumbs brushing against chest when they come hear the body.
 
<P>WARM-HANDS - Hold palms of (2h)[5] against an imaginary fire.
 
<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>HAND-DOWN - (2h)[O^], revolve around each other as they move from the DS shoulder forward.  
 
<P>TIME-GOES-FAST - The sign PROCESS, like NEXT with hands leapfrogging over one another is signed faster than usual. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/p/W3049.htm">ASL browser - process</A>.
 
<P>COMING - (2h)[1] circle around each other as in SIGN, but the hands come towards signer as if something is coming out of the future.
 
<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder. 
 
<P>SO-WHAT - [B^] is put under the chin and moves away while rubbing the dorsal side of the fingers against the chin. The hand ends as [B] with palm up.
        
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Deck the halls with boughs of holly 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
<BR>'Tis the season to be jolly

<BR>Don we now our gay apparel

<BR>Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. 

<P>2. See the blazing Yule before us. 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
<BR>Strike the harp and join the chorus. 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
<BR>Follow me in merry measure. 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
<BR>While I tell of Yule-tide treasure. 
<BR>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
