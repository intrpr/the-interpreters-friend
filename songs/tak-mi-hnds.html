<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Take my hands and make them as your own,
<BR>and use them for your kingdom here on earth.
<BR>Consecrate them to your care, anoint them for your service
<BR>where you may need your gospel to be sown.

<P>2. Take my hands, they speak now for my heart,
<BR>and by their actions they will show your love.
<BR>Guard them on their daily course, be their strength
<BR>and guiding force to ever serve the Trinity above.

<P>3. Take my hands; I give them to you, Lord.
<BR>Prepare them for the service of your name.
<BR>Open them to human need and by their love they'll sow 
<BR>your seed so all may know the love and hope you gave.
