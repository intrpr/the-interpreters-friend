<P>WE PRAY NOTHING BAD ENTER OUR DOOR.  
<BR>WE PRAY BAD #LUCK NOT SNEAK-IN OUR WINDOW. 
<BR>(&lt;) THUNDER, (>) LIGHTNING, SHOO-AWAY.

<P>OUR HOUSE STRUCTURE STRONG MEAN 
<BR>STORM CRASH-AGAINST-SIDE NOTHING-TO-IT.  
<BR>OUTSIDE MAYBE COLD* CHILLING, 
<BR>BUT OUR FIRE PLACE HOLD-HANDS-TO-FIRE INSPIRED WARM.

<P>PEACE MULTIPLE-INTERACT SOFT HERE ROOM++.
<BR>OUR MOUTH TASTE THAT HOLY WINE.  
<BR>EVERYDAY THINGS WE OWN HIT* 
<BR>BECOME HOLY THEMSELVES.

<P>WE HOPE LAUGHTER REPLACE YELLING.  
<BR>WE KNOW-THAT OUR WALL SEEM THIN, 
<BR>BUT STILL WE PRAY H-A-T-E STAY OUTSIDE 
<BR>AND L-O-V-E STAY INSIDE.  AMEN. 
 
<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SNEAK-IN - [1], PO down, FO away, moves in a zig-zag pattern, passing under [B], PO down, FO away.

<P>SHOO-AWAY - (2h)[B], PO down, FO away, hands move foward while bending at wrist and rising as if shooing something away. 

<P>CRASH-AGAINST-SIDE - DH [5wg] approaches NDH [B], PO > DS, FO up, and runs up the side of NDH. 

<P>NOTHING-TO-IT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, sway symmetrically from side to side.  

<P>CHILLING - (2h)[B] fan face with NMS of pursed lips.

<P>HOLD-HANDS-TO-FIRE - Mime how one holds one hands in front of a fire to warm them.  It is interesting to note that this is the sign for "fire" in British Sign Language.

<P>MULTIPLE-INTERACT - (2h)[5] revolve around one another with the DH held higher and revolving from above and NDH revolving from below.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>May nothing evil cross this door,
<BR>And may ill-fortune never pry
<BR>About these windows; may the roar
<BR>And rains go by.

<P>Strengthened by faith, the rafters will
<BR>Withstand the battering of the storm.
<BR>This hearth, though all the world go chill
<BR>Will keep you warm.
	
<P>Peace shall walk softly through these rooms,
<BR>Touching your lips with holy wine,
<BR>Til every casual corner blooms
<BR>Into a shrine.

<P>Laughter shall drown the raucous shout
<BR>And, though the sheltering walls are thin,
<BR>May they be strong to keep hate out
<BR>And hold love in.
