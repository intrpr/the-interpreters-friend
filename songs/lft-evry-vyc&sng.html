<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> UP-UP-UP - (2h)[B], POs up, FOs away, hands nod upwards 3x at wrists as if batting a ball upwards as they rise.

<P>LOUD - Touch ear with index finger then (2h)[S], PO down, FO away, move antisymmetrically from side to side while mouthing "pow". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/t/W4151.htm">ASL browser - thunder.</A>

<P>RISE-TO - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, rise with wg.

<P>CRASH-ON-SHORE - (2h)[B], POs down, DH FO > NDS, moves > NDH, strikes with palm and wgs while running over the shore line, mouth "pow" and withdraw.

<P>LEARN-LESSON - FT of [O^] touch forhead, and then hand opens to [B] and touches forehead with the palm. 

<P>MARCH - (2h)[4] bend at wrist and straighten out hands as if marching forward.  For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/m/march_verb.swf">ASL Pro: March.</A>  

<P>UNTIL - TO.

<P>PAH! - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>.

<P>ANCESTORS - PARENTS + (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move in a vertical circle while moving back over shoulder. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>MANY-LOOK-UP - (2h)[4] move FT as if many eyes were looking towards. 

<P>ALL-ALONG - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, fingers run up the chest on DS until POs are > signer, and FOs are up.  

<P>EXHAUSTED - TIRED + [V], PO up, FO > NDS, is drawn with effort across the palm of [B], PO up, FO away.

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>STRAY-FROM-PATH - Like the sign OFF-THE-POINT but the DH flicks index finger to one side and then to the other side; it's another way to sign the concept "sin". 

<P>TEMPT - (2h)[A^] hold imaginary pitchfork and poke at the person being tempted. Don't confuse this with TEMPTED, which is  FT of [X] taps elbow. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lift every voice and sing, till earth and Heaven ring,
<BR>Ring with the harmonies of liberty;
<BR>Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies,
<BR>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
<BR>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
<BR>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
<BR>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
<BR>Let us march on till victory is won.

<P>2. Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,
<BR>Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
<BR>Yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet,
<BR>Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
<BR>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
<BR>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered;
<BR>Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
<BR>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

<P>3. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
<BR>Thou Who hast brought us thus far on the way;
<BR>Thou Who hast by Thy might, led us into the light,
<BR>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
<BR>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee.
<BR>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee.
<BR>Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand,
<BR>True to our God, true to our native land.
