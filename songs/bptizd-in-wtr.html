<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Baptized in water, sealed by the Spirit,
<BR>Cleansed by the blood of Christ our king;
<BR>Heirs of salvation, trusting his promise -
<BR>Faithfully now God's praise we sing.

<P>2. Baptized in water, sealed by the Spirit,
<BR>Dead in the tomb with Christ our king;
<BR>One with his rising, freed and forgiven,
<BR>Thankfully now God's praise we sing.

<P>3. Baptized in water, sealed by the Spirit,
<BR>Marked with the sign of Christ our king;
<BR>Born of one Father, we are his children -
<BR>Joyfully now God's praise we sing.
