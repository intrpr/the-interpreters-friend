<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH - held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>RAMPART - [S] arm is held out horizontally, FO > DS, [V] looks out in a sweep over the "wall". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/R/W3183.htm">ASL browser - rampart</A>.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>HAVE-NONE - (2h)[B], POs > signer move upwards past mouth and swing upwards and apart while mouth blows on hands as they pass.

<P>NAME~SHINY - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.
