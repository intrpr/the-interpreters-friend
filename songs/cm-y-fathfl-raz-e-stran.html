<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, ye faithful, raise the strain of triumphant gladness;
<BR>God hath brought forth Israel into joy from sadness;
<BR>Loosed from Pharaoh’s bitter yoke Jacob’s sons and daughters,
<BR>Led them with unmoistened foot through the Red Sea waters.

<P>2. ’Tis the spring of souls today; Christ has burst His prison,
<BR>And from three days’ sleep in death as a sun hath risen;
<BR>All the winter of our sins, long and dark, is flying
<BR>From His light, to Whom we give laud and praise undying.

<P>3. Now the queen of seasons, bright with the day of splendor,
<BR>With the royal feast of feasts, comes its joy to render;
<BR>Comes to glad Jerusalem, who with true affection
<BR>Welcomes in unwearied strains Jesus’ resurrection.

<P>4. Neither might the gates of death, nor the tomb’s dark portal,
<BR>Nor the watchers, nor the seal hold Thee as a mortal;
<BR>But today amidst the twelve Thou didst stand, bestowing
<BR>That Thy peace which evermore passeth human knowing.

<P>5. “Alleluia!” now we cry to our King immortal,
<BR>Who, triumphant, burst the bars of the tomb’s dark portal;
<BR>“Alleluia!” with the Son, God the Father praising,
<BR>“Alleluia!” yet again to the Spirit raising.
