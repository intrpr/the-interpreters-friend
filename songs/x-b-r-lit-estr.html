<P>1. This is the night of new beginnings. 
<BR>This is the night when heaven meets earth.
<BR>This is the night filled with God's glory,
<BR>Promise of our new birth!

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Christ, be our light! Shine in our hearts.
<BR>Shine through the darkness.
<BR>Christ, be our light! Shine in your Church
<BR>Gathered today.

<P>2. This is the night Christ our redeemer 
<BR>Rose from the grave triumphant and free, 
<BR>Leaving the tomb of evil and darkness, 
<BR>Empty for all to see. 

<P>3. Now will the fire kindled in darkness 
<BR>Burn to dispel the shadows of night. 
<BR>Star of the morning, Jesus our Savior,
<BR>You are the world's true light.

<P>4. Sing of the hope deeper than dying.
<BR>Sing of the power stronger than death.
<BR>Sing of the love endless as heaven,
<BR>Dawning throughout the earth.

<P>5. Into this world morning is breaking.
<BR>All of God's people, lift up your voice.
<BR>Cry out with joy, tell out the story,
<BR>All of the earth rejoice.
