<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. For the healing of the nations,
<BR>Lord, we pray with one accord,
<BR>for a just and equal sharing
<BR>of the things that earth affords.
<BR>To a life of love in action
<BR>help us rise and pledge our word.

<P>2. Lead us forward into freedom,
<BR>from despair your world release,
<BR>that, redeemed from war and hatred,
<BR>all may come and go in peace.
<BR>Show us how through care and goodness
<BR>fear will die and hope increase.

<P>3. All that kills abundant living,
<BR>let it from the earth be banned:
<BR>pride of status, race or schooling,
<BR>dogmas that obscure your plan.
<BR>In our common quest for justice
<BR>may we hallow brief life's span.

<P>4. You, Creator God, have written
<BR>your great name on humankind;
<BR>for our growing in your likeness
<BR>bring the life of Christ to mind;
<BR>that by our response and service
<BR>earth its destiny may find.
