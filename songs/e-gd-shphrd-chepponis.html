<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I am the good shepherd; I care for my flock; 
<BR>for you I lay down my life, and I lead you home.

<P>1. The Lord is my shepherd; I have everything I need. 
<BR>Fresh and green are the meadows where he gives me repose. 
<BR>Near quiet waters he leads me to revive my soul. 
<BR>He guides me in right paths; he is true to his Word. 

<P>2. Even though I walk in the valley of darkness, I fear no evil; 
<BR>for you are at my side with your rod and your staff to comfort me.

<P>3. You have prepared a feast for me in the sight of my foes; 
<BR>my head you have anointed with oil; my cup overflows. 
<BR>Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life; 
<BR>I am the good shepherd; I care for my flock 
<BR>(I shall dwell in the Lord's house) and I lead you home. (forever.)
