<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Helpless and hungry, lowly, afraid, 
<BR>wrapped in the chill of midwinter; 
<BR>comes now among us, born into poverty's embrace, 
<BR>new life for the world.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Who is this who lives with the lowly, 
<BR>sharing their sorrows, knowing their hunger? 
<BR>This is Christ, revealed to the world 
<BR>in the eyes of a child, a child of the poor.

<P>2. Who is the stranger here in our midst, 
<BR>looking for shelter among us? 
<BR>Who is the outcast? Who do we see amidst the poor, 
<BR>the children of God?

<P>3. Bring all the thirsty, all who seek peace; 
<BR>bring those with nothing to offer. 
<BR>Strengthen the feeble, say to the frightened heart: 
<BR>"Fear not: here is your God!"
