<P>1. For the fruits of this creation, thanks be to God
<BR>For the gifts of every nation, thanks be to God
<BR>For the plowing, sowing, reaping,
<BR>Silent growth while we are sleeping,
<BR>Future needs in earth's safekeeping, thanks be to God.

<P>2. In the just reward of labor, God's will be done.
<BR>In the help we give our neighbor, God's will be done.
<BR>In the world-wide task of caring,
<BR>For the hungry and despairing,
<BR>In the harvests we are sharing, God's will be done.

<P>3. For the harvests of the Spirit, thanks be to God.
<BR>For the good we all inherit, thanks be to God.
<BR>For the wonders that astound us,
<BR>For the truths that will confound us,
<BR>Most of all that love has found us, thanks be to God.
