<P>In praise of music,
<BR>We will sing a new song,
<BR>In praise of music,
<BR>Come and sing along.
 
<P>We are the music makers,
<BR>And we are the dreamers of the dreams.
<BR>We are the music makers,
<BR>So we will sing.
 
<P>In praise of music,
<BR>We will sing a new song,
<BR>In praise of music,
<BR>Come and sing along.
 
<P>Music, the greatest good that mortals know,
<BR>And all of heaven, all of heaven we have here below.
 
<P>In praise of music,
<BR>We will sing a new song,
<BR>In praise of music,
<BR>Come and sing along.
 
<P>In praise of music,
<BR>We will sing a new song,
<BR>In praise of music.
