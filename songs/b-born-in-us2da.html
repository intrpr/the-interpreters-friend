<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Through the winter and the cold, 
<BR>our faith can weaken and grow old; 
<BR>so we ache to find a song of a God, 
<BR>one to whom we can belong. 
<BR>Instead of power shown as might, 
<BR>a tiny baby is your light; 
<BR>we find a child who sings the way. 
<BR>Come now, be born in us today.

<P>2. Christmas comes and Christmas goes, 
<BR>yet pain and violence sadly grow. 
<BR>We cry and hurt. When will it end? 
<BR>Is there a savior, a messiah whom you'll send? 
<BR>We pray in hope, please hear our cry, 
<BR>or is the story just a lie? 
<BR>We need the child to show the way. 
<BR>Come now, be born in us today.

<P>3. In this time of joy and cheer, 
<BR>we find resentment, bound by fear; 
<BR>called to believe, but we are blind, 
<BR>give us a reason, a lifeline we can find. 
<BR>Poisoned by selfishness and hate, 
<BR>how much longer must we wait? 
<BR>This child brings life to our decay.
<BR>Come now be born in us today.

<P>4. Give us a sign that you are real. 
<BR>Numb though we are, help us to feel. 
<BR>There's only one gift that we need, 
<BR>a manger, too, where all can come and feed.  
<BR>We need to know we're not alone, 
<BR>a place of safety, a home. 
<BR>Although the cross is here to stay, 
<BR>come now, be born in us today. 
<BR>Come now be born in us today.
