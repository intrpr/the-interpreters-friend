<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SURFACE-MEET-FEET - [V] is held as in the sign STAND and the dorsal (back) side of the NDH comes up from underneath and meets the "feet". 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>.

<P>ABOVE - (2h)[5], POs &lt;, FOs away, DH starts touching the NDH on the dorsal (back) side  and then spirals above it. 

<P>JUMP-FOR-JOY - Start with the sign STAND and repeatedly and rapidly raise and lower the DH while curling the FT to show a person jumping. 

<P>PURE - Like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>May the road rise to meet you,
<BR>May the wind be always at your back.
<BR>May the sun shine warm upon your face,
<BR>The rains fall soft upon your fields.
<BR>And until we meet again,
<BR>May God hold you in the palm of his hand.

<P>May God be with you and bless you:
<BR>May you see your children's children.
<BR>May you be poor in misfortune,
<BR>Rich in blessings.
<BR>May you know nothing but happiness
<BR>From this day forward.

<P>May the road rise up to meet you
<BR>May the wind be always at your back
<BR>May the warm rays of sun fall upon your home
<BR>And may the hand of a friend always be near.

<P>May green be the grass you walk on,
<BR>May blue be the skies above you,
<BR>May pure be the joys that surround you,
<BR>May true be the hearts that love you.
