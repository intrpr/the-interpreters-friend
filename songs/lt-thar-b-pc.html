<P>1. Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me. 
<BR>Let there be peace on earth, the peace that was meant to be! 
<BR>With God as our Father, brothers all are we. 
<BR>Let me walk with my brother in perfect harmony. 

<P>2. Let peace begin with me. Let this be the moment now. 
<BR>With ev'ry breath I take, let this be my solemn vow; 
<BR>To take each moment and live each moment in peace eternally! 
<BR>Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me!
