<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: I will lift up my eyes at the name of the one who knows me well.

<P>1. You are my God, whom I seek with my life; for you I thirst, as the earth for water. Lifeless and parched, without you I am nowhere, no one at all.

<P>2. Thus have I seen you in your holy house, with my own eyes, how faithful and sure. More than life, your mercy endures longer than time.

<P>3. Thus shall I bless you while I am alive; calling on you, my breath and my bread. And with a song through day and the darkness clinging to you.

<P>4. And when I shall see that day when your justice and power will break the chains that bind me. And mine enemies' lies strewn broken and empty; your mighty hand, that awful grace.
