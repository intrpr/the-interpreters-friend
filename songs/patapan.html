<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Willie, take up your drum.
<BR>Robin, take your flute and come.
<BR>When we hear the tune you play,
<BR>Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan,
<BR>When we hear the tune you play,
<BR>How can anyone be glum?

<P>2. When the men of olden days
<BR>Gave the King of Kings their praise,
<BR>They had pipes on which to play:
<BR>Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan
<BR>They had drums on which to play,
<BR>Full of joy on Christmas Day

<P>3. God and man this day become
<BR>Joined as one with flute and drum.
<BR>Let the happy tune play on:
<BR>Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan.
<BR>Flute and drum play together,
<BR>As we sing on Christmas Day.
