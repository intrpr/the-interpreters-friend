<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>La Guitarra (The Guitar)

<P>The weeping of the guitar begins. The glasses of dawn break. The weeping of the guitar begins. 

<P>It’s useless to silence it. It’s impossible to silence it. It cries, monotonously, like the waters cry, like the wind cries over the snowfall. 

<P>It’s useless to silence it. It’s impossible to silence it. 

<P>It weeps for things far away. The hot southern sand asking for white camellias. 

<P>The arrow without target cries, the evening without morning, and for the first bird dying on the branch. 

<P>Oh, guitar! Heart wounded by five swords.

<P>Procesi&oacute;n (Procession)

<P>Down the road come strange unicorns. From which field? From which mythological wood? When closer they seem like astronomers. Fantastic Merlins and the ecce homo [an image of Christ], Haunted Durandarte, Furious Orlando [mythological characters].

<P>Paso (Passage)

<P>Virgin with billowing skirt, virgin of solitude, opening like an immense tulip.

<P>In your ship of lights you head towards the high tide of the city, among dark insults and crystal stars.

<P>Virgin with billowing skirt, virgin of solitude, you go on the river from the street to the sea!

<P>Saeta (Devotional Song)

<P>The darkened Christ walks past a lily of Judea, then to a carnation of Spain. Watch him come! Watch him go! 

<P>From Spain, the sky, clean and dark, the earth scorched, and ditches where water runs very slowly.

<P>The darkened Christ, his long hair with burned hue, prominent cheekbones and pupils white. Watch him come! Watch him go!
