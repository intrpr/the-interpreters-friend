<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>KIND(NESS) - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.

<P>HAVE-MERCY-ON-us - (2h)[open 8], POs > signer, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/mercy_b.swf">ASL Pro: Mercy - 2.</A>

<P>BOW-DOWN(-TO) - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.  

<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>alt.GIFT-TO-me - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands alt. tip back towards signer to show that something is given as a gift.

<P>FORGIVE - A more elegant sign that a simple EXCUSE is to sign EXCUSE, switch dominance and sign EXCUSE again. 

<P>ALL - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A>  

<P>GRIEF - (2h)[S] twist at heart.

<P>PAY-OFF - [open 8] runs middle finger up palm (> wrist), changes to a [B], PO down, and then moves back across palm. 

<P>DEBT - [1^] taps FT against palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/d/debt.swf">ASL Pro: Debt.</A>  

<P>CROWN-you - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) take crown from head and place it on imaginary head in front of signer with large single movement. 

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A> 

<P>HAVE-MERCY-ON-us, HAVE-MERCY-ON-US - The reason for the seemingly gratuitous repetation in the original (Merciful, merciful and gracious is our God) is in reference to the <I>trai asar midot</I> or 13 attributes of God, shown to Moses while he hid in the cliff. They start out, <I>Adonai, Adonai</I> which would usually mean "Lord, Lord", but the Rabbis interpret this as "merciful (in the past) and merciful (in the future)." For this reason I have retained the repetition, although almost no one in the congregation, hearing or Deaf, will get it.

<P>BLOW-TOP - [5], PO down, FO away, strikes top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and rises up again, twisting DH at wrist.

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P><B>Refrain</B>: The Lord is kind and merciful. (2x)

<P>1. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all my being bless his name; bless the Lord and forget not his benefits.

<P>2. He pardons all your iniquities, and comforts your sorrows, redeems your life from destruction, and crowns you with his kindness.

<P>3. Merciful, merciful and gracious is our God; slow to anger, abounding in kindness.
