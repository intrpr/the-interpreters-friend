<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Morning, So Fair to See, night, veiled in mystery -
<BR>Glorious the earth and resplendent skies!
<BR>Pilgrims, we march along, singing our
<BR>Joyous song, as through an earthly paradise.

<P>Tall are the verdant trees; deep are the flashing seas;
<BR>Glorious each wonder the seasons bring.
<BR>Brighter is faith's surmise, shining in
<BR>Pilgrim eyes, from which our waking spirits spring.

<P>Age after age we rise, 'neath the eternal skies,
<BR>Into the light from the shadowed past:
<BR>Still shall our pilgrim song, buoyant and
<BR>Brave and strong, resound while life and mountains last.
