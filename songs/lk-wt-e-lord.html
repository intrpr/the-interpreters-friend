<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<!-- 
1. The lame man set outside the gate
Begging alms of those who entered in
Now Peter and John they came upon him
The lame man expecting form them
Peter said silver and gold have I none
But such I have Give unto Thee
Right then the spirit touched him
And he leaped to his feet
Saying look what Gods done for me <B>Refrain</B>
 
2. I was bound by chains of darkness and sin
I had no hope or peace of mind
Though my sins were red as scarlet
He washed them white as s
And opened my blind eyes
Now my soul will rejoice since I’ve made Him my choice
I’ve got joy, peace, everything that’s within
You see my names been written down
In the lambs book of life
Can’t you see what Gods done for me <B>Refrain</B>
 
TAG
Come on and praise Him
Look what the Lord has done-->

<P>Look what the Lord has done.
<BR>Look what the Lord has done.
<BR>He healed my body.
<BR>He touched my mind.
<BR>He saved me just in time.
<BR>I'm gonna praise His name.
<BR>Each day is just the same.
<BR>Come on and praise Him.
<BR>Look what the Lord has done.
