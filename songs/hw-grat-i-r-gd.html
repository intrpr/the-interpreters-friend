<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>SPLENDOR - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>ALL - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
<BR>Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
<BR>He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
<BR>And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> How great is our God, sing with me,
<BR>How great is our God, all will see,
<BR>How great, how great is our God.

<P>2. Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
<BR>Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
<BR>The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
<BR>The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

<P>Name above all names, Worthy of all praise,
<BR>My heart will sing  How great is our God
