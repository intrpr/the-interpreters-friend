<P><B>Refrain</B>: I will never leave you, I will not leave you orphaned;
<BR>I'll come back to you, Soon you will be with me,
<BR>and I'll be one with God,
<BR>and you in me, and I in you.

<P>1. If you love me and keep my commands,
<BR>God will send you the breath of life, the bringer of truth.

<P>2. You will know me if you keep my commands.
<BR>My Spirit I will give to be with you, throughout all time.

<P>3. In a little while the world will no longer see me,
<BR>But you will see me; because I live, you too shall live.
