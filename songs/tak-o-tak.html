<P>PLEASE ACCEPT <U>ME</U>, KNOW+ <U>ME</U> WEAK. 
<BR>SUMMON OUT-OF-me BEST CAN BECOME. 
<BR>YOUR SEAL, STAMP-heart MY HEART 
<BR>AND LIVE INSIDE-SELF <U>ME</U>.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>OUT-OF-me - Like the normal sign OUT but the NDH FT are held against the chest.  

<P>SEAL - [S], PO > NDS, FO away, stamps upturned palm.

<P>STAMP-heart - [S],  PO up, FO > NDS, stamps heart.

<P>INSIDE-me - Like the normal sign IN but the NDH FT are held against the chest.    

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Take, O take me as I am; 
<BR>Summon out what I shall be;
<BR>Set your seal upon my heart
<BR>And live in me.
