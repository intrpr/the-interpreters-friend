<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Lord, whose love in humble service 
<BR>bore the weight of human need, 
<BR>who upon the cross, forsaken, 
<BR>worked your mercy's perfect deed; 
<BR>we, your servants, bring the worship 
<BR>not of voice alone, but heart, 
<BR>consecrating to your purpose 
<BR>every gift which you impart.

<P>2. Still your children wander homeless, 
<BR>still the hungry cry for bread. 
<BR>Still the captives long for freedom, 
<BR>still in grief we mourn our dead. 
<BR>As you, Lord, in deep compassion, 
<BR>healed the sick and freed the soul, 
<BR>by your Spirit send your power 
<BR>to our world to make it whole.

<P>3. As we worship, grant us vision, 
<BR>till your love's revealing light 
<BR>in its height and depth and greatness 
<BR>dawns upon our quickened sight, 
<BR>making known the needs and burdens 
<BR>your compassion bids us bear, 
<BR>stirring us to ardent service, 
<BR>your abundant life to share.
