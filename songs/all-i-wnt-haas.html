<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>GET-TO KNOW - GO-AHEAD KNOW, where the first sign is (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>THAT'S-#ALL - FINISH with the mouthing "that's all". 

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist. 

<P>RISE - [V], PO up, FO away, pronates and hops onto the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_resurrection.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Resurrection.</A>

<P>LEAVE-BEHIND - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, body twists and hands descend close to signer's back.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> All I want, all I need is to know Christ; to follow the Lord. I press on toward the goal, the prize of the call of God.

<P>1. Everything but this is loss and worthless to me. After gaining Christ, there is nothing, nothing that I need.

<P>2. I want to know the Lord, and the power of God's love; Becoming like Christ in death, I may rise, rise to new life.

<P>3. Forgetting what lies behind, forward I'll go. I press on to make it my own; Christ Jesus made me whole.
