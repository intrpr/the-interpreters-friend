<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. Once in royal David's city
<BR>Stood a lowly cattle shed,
<BR>Where a mother laid her Baby
<BR>In a manger for His bed:
<BR>Mary was that mother mild,
<BR>Jesus Christ her little Child.

<P>2. He came down to earth from Heaven,
<BR>Who is God and Lord of all,
<BR>And His shelter was a stable,
<BR>And His cradle was a stall;
<BR>With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
<BR>Lived on earth our Savior holy.

<P>3. And, through all His wondrous childhood,
<BR>He would honor and obey,
<BR>Love and watch the lowly maiden,
<BR>In whose gentle arms He lay:
<BR>Christian children all must be
<BR>Mild, obedient, good as He.

<P>4. For He is our childhood's pattern;
<BR>Day by day, like us He grew;
<BR>He was little, weak and helpless,
<BR>Tears and smiles like us He knew;
<BR>And He feeleth for our sadness,
<BR>And He shareth in our gladness.

<P>5. And our eyes at last shall see Him,
<BR>Through His own redeeming love,
<BR>For that Child so dear and gentle
<BR>Is our Lord in Heav'n above,
<BR>And He leads His children on
<BR>To the place where He is gone.

<P>6. Not in that poor lowly stable,
<BR>With the oxen standing by,
<BR>We shall see Him; but in Heaven,
<BR>Set at God's right hand on high;
<BR>Where like stars His children crowned
<BR>All in white shall wait around.
