<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When I was growing up my best friend was a unicorn
<BR>The others smiled at me and called me crazy
<BR>But I was not upset by knowing I did not conform
<BR>I always thought their seeing must be hazy.
<BR>The unicorn and I would while away the hours
<BR>Playing, dancing and romancing in the wild flowers
<BR>And we'd sing

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Seeing is believing in the things you see
<BR>Loving is believing in the ones you love.
<BR>Seeing is believing in the things you see
<BR>Loving is believing in the ones you love.

<P>When I was seventeen my best friend was the northern star
<BR>The others asked why I was always dreaming
<BR>When I did not reply I found my thoughts were very far
<BR>Away from daily hurts and fears and scheming.
<BR>The northern star and I would share our dreams together
<BR>Laughing, sighing, sometimes crying, in all kinds of weather
<BR>And we'd sing <U>Chorus</U>

<P>And now that I am grown, my best friend lives inside of me
<BR>The others smile at me and call me crazy
<BR>But I am not upset, for long ago I found the key
<BR>I've always known their seeing must be hazy.
<BR>My friend inside and I would while away the hours
<BR>Playing, dancing and romancing in the wild flowers
<BR>And we'd sing <U>Chorus</U> (twice)
