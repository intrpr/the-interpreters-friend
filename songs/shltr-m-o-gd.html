<P><B>Refrain:</B> PROTECT <U>ME</U> IDEA~LIKE FORTRESS, GOD. YOUR-rt WINGS HIDE <U>ME</U>; SUNSHINE STRONG, NOT HURT. MY HOPE DEPEND-ON-rt <U>YOU</U>-rt.

<P>1. HAPPEN ENEMY SURROUND-me, PLEASE PLACE-ABOVE-them <U>ME</U>, TOUCH CAN'T. IF <U>ME</U> SUMMON <U>YOU</U>-rt, PLEASE ATTEND-TO-me.

<P>2. IDEA~LIKE MOTHER BIRD TAKE-CARE-OF HER-lf CHILDREN. <U>THEY</U>-rt ASSEMBLE, MOTHER FOLD-WINGS-OVER. PLEASE PROTECT <U>ME</U> SAME-AS-rt.

<P>3. KNOW-THAT <U>ME</U> WALK PLACE DARK, CROWDED, 1-CL'walk crooked path', <U>YOU</U>-rt IGNORE-me <U>ME</U> NEVER. SUPPORT++.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>FORTRESS - (2h)[S], POs down, FOs &gt;&lt;, strike the whole length of the forearms together like TABLE then DH is held under NDH and the arms strike again.

<P>WINGS - (2h)[B] flutter like wings. 

<P>SURROUND-me - (2h)[1], POs > signer, FOs up, start with hands touching and move symmetrically in a semi-circle to show that signer is surrounded.

<P>PLACE-ABOVE-them - DH [S], PO > NDS, FO away, is held below downturned palm, and DH moves so that it is then above the NDH.

<P>ATTEND-TO-me - PAY-ATTENTION-TO is directed towards signer.

<P>ASSEMBLE - (2h)[S], FO > signer, move > signer while opening to (2h)[5wg].  

<P>FOLD-WINGS-UNDER - (2h)[B] are folded with FOs down rather than up as in REST.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>CROWDED - (2h)[S] press wrists together and twist like CHANGE with hunched shoulders and "zz".

<P>1-CL'walk crooked path' - [1], PO away, FO up, moves away from signer in a crooked path. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Shelter me, O God; hide me in the shadow of your wings. You alone are my hope.

<P>1. When my foes surround me, set me high above their reach. Hear me when I call your name.

<P>2. As a mother gathers her young beneath her care, gather me into your arms.

<P>3. Though I walk in darkness, through the needle's eye of death, you will never leave my side.
