<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O beautiful for spacious skies, 
<BR>For amber waves of grain, 
<BR>For purple mountain majesties 
<BR>Above the fruited plain! 
<BR>America! America! 
<BR>God shed his grace on thee 
<BR>And crown thy good with brotherhood
<BR>From sea to shining sea!

<P>2. O beautiful for pilgrim feet
<BR>Whose stern, impassioned stress
<BR>A thoroughfare for freedom beat
<BR>Across the wilderness!
<BR>America! America!
<BR>God mend thine every flaw,
<BR>Confirm thy soul in self-control,
<BR>Thy liberty in law!

<P>3. O beautiful for heroes proved In liberating strife. 
<BR>Who more than self the country loved
<BR>And mercy more than life! 
<BR>America! America!
<BR>May God thy gold refine 
<BR>Till all success be nobleness 
<BR>And every gain divine!

<P>4. O beautiful for patriot dream 
<BR>That sees beyond the years 
<BR>Thine alabaster cities gleam 
<BR>Undimmed by human tears! 
<BR>America! America! 
<BR>God shed his grace on thee 
<BR>And crown thy good with brotherhood 
<BR>From sea to shining sea!

<P>5. O beautiful for halcyon skies,
<BR>For amber waves of grain,
<BR>For purple mountain majesties
<BR>Above the enameled plain!
<BR>America! America!
<BR>God shed his grace on thee
<BR>Till souls wax fair as earth and air
<BR>And music-hearted sea!

<P>6. O beautiful for pilgrims feet,
<BR>Whose stern impassioned stress
<BR>A thoroughfare for freedom beat
<BR>Across the wilderness!
<BR>America ! America !
<BR>God shed his grace on thee
<BR>Till paths be wrought through wilds of thought
<BR>By pilgrim foot and knee!

<P>7. O beautiful for glory-tale
<BR>Of liberating strife
<BR>When once and twice,
<BR>for man's avail
<BR>Men lavished precious life !
<BR>America! America! 
<BR>God shed his grace on thee
<BR>Till selfish gain no longer stain 
<BR>The banner of the free!

<P>8. O beautiful for patriot dream 
<BR>That sees beyond the years
<BR>Thine alabaster cities gleam
<BR>Undimmed by human tears! 
<BR>America! America!
<BR>God shed his grace on thee
<BR>Till nobler men keep once again 
<BR>Thy whiter jubilee!
