<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> (Verse 5 is sometimes omitted)

<P>1. O young and fearless Prophet of ancient Galilee,
<BR>Thy life is still a summons to serve humanity;
<BR>To make our thoughts and actions less prone to please the crowd,
<BR>To stand with humble courage for truth with hearts uncowed.

<P>2. We marvel at the purpose that held Thee to Thy course
<BR>While ever on the hilltop before Thee loomed the cross;
<BR>Thy steadfast face set forward where love and duty shone,
<BR>While we betray so quickly and leave Thee there alone.

<P>3. O help us stand unswerving against war’s bloody way,
<BR>Where hate and lust and falsehood hold back Christ’s holy sway;
<BR>Forbid false love of country that blinds us to His call,
<BR>Who lifts above the nations the unity of all.

<P>4. Stir up in us a protest against our greed for wealth,
<BR>While others starve and hunger and plead for work and health;
<BR>Where homes with little children cry out for lack of bread,
<BR>Who live their years sore burdened beneath a gloomy dread.

<P>5. Create in us the splendor that dawns when hearts are kind,
<BR>That knows not race nor station as boundaries of the mind;
<BR>That learns to value beauty, in heart, or brain, or soul,
<BR>And longs to bind God’s children into one perfect whole.

<P>6. O young and fearless Prophet, we need Thy presence here,
<BR>Amid our pride and glory to see Thy face appear;
<BR>Once more to hear Thy challenge above our noisy day,
<BR>Again to lead us forward along God’s holy way.
