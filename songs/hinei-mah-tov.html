<P>Hinei ma tov uma na-im
<BR>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
<BR>KNOW-THAT OUR LIFE GOOD, SWEET

<P>Shevet achim gam yachad.
<BR>For brothers to dwell together in unity.
<BR>IF WE TOGETHER LIKE FAMILY.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P><IMG SRC="treble-clef.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="treble clef as a symbol for music">To hear the z'mir (song), go to <A HREF="http://www.hotshabbat.com/">HotShabbat.com</A>, go to "Susan Colin" and click on "Hinei Mah Tov". This is the most frequently used niggun (melody), but there is also a charming Celtic one under "Peter and Ellen Allard".
