<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> GATHER - DH [5:], PO down, FO away, "scrapes" things into the NDH which is below it as a [B], PO up, FO away and both hands move from DS to NDS.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - INSIDE held against the chest.

<P>BLEND~COOPERATE - (2h)[5:], POs > signer, are interlaced and FTs move down like a gear that blends into the sign COOPERATE.

<P>ASSEMBLE - (2h)[S] opens to a [5wg] as the hands come towards signer from their respective sides.

<P>NURTURE-seeds - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature.  I added "seeds" to show what we are nurturing.

<P>LEARN-LESSON - Touch the forehead with the FT of [O^] and then with the palm of [B].

<P>moon-PULL-UPWARDS - (2h)[S], POs away, behave as if holding onto rope that is connecting the signer to the moon and pulling it upwards.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Gather the spirit, harvest the power!
<BR>Our separate fires will kindle one flame.
<BR>Witness the mystery of this hour!
<BR>Our trials in this light appear all the same.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Gather in peace, gather in thanks!
<BR>Gather in sympathy now and then!
<BR>Gather in hope, compassion and strength!
<BR>Gather to celebrate once again!

<P>2. Gather the spirit of heart and mind!
<BR>Seeds for the sowing are laid in store,
<BR>Nurtured in love, and conscience refined,
<BR>With body and spirit united once more. 

<P>3. Gather the spirit growing in all,
<BR>Drawn by the moon and fed by the sun,
<BR>Winter to spring, and summer to fall,
<BR>The chorus of life resounding as one!
