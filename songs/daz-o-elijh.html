<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. These are the days of Elijah
<BR>Declaring the Word of the Lord
<BR>And these are the days of your servant Moses
<BR>Righteousness being restored
<BR>And though these are days of great trials
<BR>Of famine and darkness and sword
<BR>Still we are the voice in the desert crying
<BR>Prepare ye the way of the Lord!

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Behold He comes! Riding on the clouds!
<BR>Shining like the sun! At the trumpet call
<BR>Lift your voice! It's the year of Jubilee!
<BR>And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

<P>2. And these are the days of Ezekiel
<BR>The dry bones becoming as flesh
<BR>And these are the days of your servant David
<BR>Rebuilding a temple of praise
<BR>And these are the days of the harvest
<BR>The fields are as white in the world
<BR>And we are the labourers in your vineyard
<BR>Declaring the word of the Lord! <B>Refrain</B>
