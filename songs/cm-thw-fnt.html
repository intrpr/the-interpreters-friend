<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
<BR>Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
<BR>Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
<BR>Call for songs of loudest praise.
<BR>Teach me some melodious sonnet,
<BR>Sung by flaming tongues above.
<BR>Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
<BR>Mount of Thy redeeming love.

<P>2. Here I raise my Ebenezer;
<BR>Here by Thy great help I've come;
<BR>And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
<BR>Safely to arrive at home.
<BR>Jesus sought me when a stranger,
<BR>Wandering from the fold of God;
<BR>He, to rescue me from danger,
<BR>Interposed His precious blood.

<P>3. O to grace how great a debtor
<BR>Daily I'm constrained to be!
<BR>Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
<BR>Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
<BR>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
<BR>Prone to leave the God I love;
<BR>Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
<BR>Seal it for Thy courts above.

<P>4. O that day when freed from sinning,
<BR>I shall see Thy lovely face;
<BR>Clothed then in blood washed linen
<BR>How I'll sing Thy sovereign grace;
<BR>Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,
<BR>Take my ransomed soul away;
<BR>Send thine angels now to carry
<BR>Me to realms of endless day.
