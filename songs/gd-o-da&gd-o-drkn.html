<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. God of day and God of darkness, now we stand before the night. As the shadows stretch and deepen, come and make our darkness bright. All creation still is groaning for the dawning of your might. When the Sun of peace and justice fills the earth with radiant light.

<P>2. Still the nations curse the darkness, still the rich oppress the poor. Still the earth is bruised and broken by the ones who still want more. Come and wake us from our sleeping, so our hearts cannot ignore all your people lost and broken, all your children at our door.  

<P>3. Show us Christ in one another. Make us servants strong and true. Give us all your love of justice, so we do what you would do. Let us call all people holy. Let us pledge our lives anew. Make us one with all the lowly. Let us all be one in you.

<P>4. You shall be the path that guides us; you the light that in us burns. Shining deep within all people, yours the love that we must learn. For our hearts shall wander restless 'til they safe to you return. Finding you in one another, we shall all your face discern. 

<P>5. Praise to you in day and darkness; you our source and you our end. Praise to you who loves and nurtures us like a father, mother, friend. Grant us all a peaceful resting. Let each mind and body mend. So we rise refreshed tomorrow, hearts renewed to kingdom tend.
