<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> CACTUS - Pose like a cactus (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, NDH lower than DH. When signing BIRD (the next word) keep the NDH in place for:

<P>PERCH-ON-cactus - The NDH is still in place from CACTUS but the hand now nods down so that it brovies a flat surface for the bird to land on and the DH [V:], PO down, does just that.

<P>FLY-AWAY - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and hands flap like wings while showing the path of the flight.

<P>SKY - using the FT of the upturned palm, point > sky and sweep the hand > DS. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/s/W3674.htm">ASL browser - sky</A>.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. Most verses have some repetition to buy time during the "A la tirana na na/ A la tirana na no", which is supposed to mimic the chirping of birds.

<P>FEATHER-FAN - Sweep [4], PO > NDS, FO up, at top of head to show a cardinal's crest.

<P>LEAVES-DROOP - (2h)[5] are held out limply and descend as if drooping branches. 

<P>NEST - [bO] is held at nose like a beak and then pecks at [C], PO > DS, FO away.

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>MEXICO - You can use one of the many ASL variants for "Mexico", but I prefer the indigenous one (Mexico's own sign): [V], PO > NDS, touches index finger to temple, then twists at wrist so that FO is away and pointing down slightly. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <a href="http://www.needsoutreach.org/Cntry2/Mexico_MSTR.mov">NEEDS Outreach: Mexico.</A>	   

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>WHALE - NDH [B] horizontal arm represents the surface of an ocean. The movement of the DH [Y] shows a whale's tail diving in and out of the water > DS.  

<P>MIGHTY - (2h)[S], POs > back of signer, FOs up, are held at NDS and fists descend, then repeat at DS.

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>flood-DESCEND - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend. 

<P>EAGLE - [bC] is held at nose like a beak.

<P>PECK++ - [bO] pecks at palm.

<P>TRUMPET - Mime playing a valved trumpet.

<P>BYE++ - GOOD + [B] nods fingers at knuckles while moving NDS > DS. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>Volaron las amarillas calandrias de los nopales
<BR>Ya no cantaran alegres los p‡jaros cadernales
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no
<BR>Ya no cantaran alegres los p‡jaros cadernales

<P>&Aacute;rboles de la ladera porque no han reverdecido
<BR>Por eso calandrias cantan o las apachurra el nido
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no
<BR>Por eso calandrias cantan o las apachurra el nido

<P>Eres chiquita y bonita y as&iacute; como eres te quiero
<BR>Pareces una rosita de las costas de Guerrero
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no
<BR>Pareces una rosita de las costas de Guerrero

<P>En la mediana del mar suspiraba un ballena
<BR>Y en los suspiros deci&aacute; el que la seca la llena
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no
<BR>Y en los suspiros deci&aacute; el que la seca la llena

<P>Mi padre fue gavil&aacute;n y yo nac&iacute; pico pico
<BR>Soy como el tarantantan donde quiero meto el pico
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no

<P>Todos dan su despedida pero como esta ninguna
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no
<BR>Todos dan su despedida pero como esta ninguna

<P>Cuatro por cinco son veinte
<BR>Tres por siete son veinte-uno
<BR>Cuatro por cinco son veinte
<BR>Tres por siete son veinte-uno
<BR>Cuatro por cinco son veinte
<BR>Tres por siete son veinte-uno
<BR>A la tirana na na
<BR>A la tirana na no

<P><B>ENGLISH TRANSLATION</B> (Thanks to Dan Parvaz!)

<P>The yellow larks fly from their cactuses
<BR>No longer will the cardinals sing happily
<BR>their "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and "tirana-na-no"
<BR>No longer will the cardinals sing happily

<P>The trees on the hillside, since they haven't revived
<BR>For this the larks sing, or the nest hold them down
<BR>their "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and "tirana-na-no"
<BR>For this the larks sing, or the nest hold them down

<P>You are little and beautiful, and the way you are, I love you
<BR>You look like a little rose from  the shores of Guerrero
<BR>with your "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and "tirana-na-no"
<BR>Like a little rose from  the shores of Guerrero

<P>In the middle of the sea a whale sighed
<BR>And in those sighs he who dried up the flood spoke
<BR>with his "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and "tirana-na-no"
<BR>And in those sighs he who dried up the flood spoke

<P>My father was a sparrowhawk and I was born to peck and peck
<BR>Where I place my beak, I'm like a trumpeter
<BR>with my "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and "tirana-na-no"

<P>Everyone has their farewells, but none is like this
<BR>Like a "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and a "tirana-na-no"
<BR>Everyone has their farewells, but none is like this

<P>Four times five is twenty,
<BR>three times seven is twenty-one
<BR>Four times five is twenty,
<BR>three times seven is twenty-one
<BR>Four times five is twenty,
<BR>three times seven is twenty-one
<BR>With a "tirana-na-na"
<BR>and a "tirana-na-no"
