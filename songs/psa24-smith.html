<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P><U>THESE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>SWEEP-TO - This is used to mean "from (whatever is spatialized on the NDS) to (what is spatialized on the DS). The DH [B], PO > NDS, FO away, sweeps from NDS to DS.  

<P>TEMPLE - T-CHURCH.

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A> 

<P>EVIL - (2h)[3], wg while moving repeatedly > forehead. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_satan.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Satan.</A>

<P>NOT-YET - It may seem odd to sign what seems to say "they have not yet done evil" as if it were always a possibility in the future. Often when you ask a Deaf person if they were guilty of doing something bad, they will sign NOT-YET.

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P>BLESSING - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A>

<P>JACOB - Could be fingerspelled or signed as a [J] across the chin.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: Lord, this is the people who long to see your face. :||

<P><B>Alternate refrain:</B> ||: Lord, let the Lord enter :|| : The King of glory.

<P>1. All creation is the work of God. The earth and all creatures belong to the Lord. From mountains to valleys, from ocean to land, the Lord God made them all.

<P>2. Who will climb the sacred moutain, the holy place of God? Those who have not done evil, whose hearts are pure, whose eyes are not blind.

<P>3. God will send a blessing to honor his faithful ones. Lord, this is the people who seek the face of Jacob's God.
