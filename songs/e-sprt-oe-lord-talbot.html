<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
<BR>because our Lord has anointed me. 
<BR>He has sent me to bring glad tidings 
<BR>to the poor and to heal the broken hearted, 

<P>to proclaim liberty to the captives 
<BR>and to set the prisoners free, 
<BR>to announce a year of favor from the Lord, 
<BR>and our day of vindication to comfort all who mourn. 

<P>The Spirit of God is upon me. 
<BR>The Spirit of God has anointed me. 
<BR>The Spirit of God now doth send me 
<BR>to the poor to heal the broken-hearted.
