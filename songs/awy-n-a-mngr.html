<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, 
<BR>The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. 
<BR>The stars in the sky looked down where he lay, 
<BR>The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay. 
 
<P>2. The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes, 
<BR>But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes. 
<BR>I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky 
<BR>And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh. 
 
<P>3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay 
<BR>Close by me forever, and love me, I pray. 
<BR>Bless all the dear children in thy tender care, 
<BR>And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.
