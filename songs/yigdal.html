<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> God-HIMSELF - Any time God is not in all uppercase letters (GOD) it means to direct the sign to His space which is usually upwards and on the dominant side.

<P>MULTIPLE-COMPLEX - Like the sign COMPLICATED but 4 fingers wiggle.

<P>BIG-QUESTION - Like the sign QUESTION-MARK but both hands and all fingers (not the thumb) form a symmetric shape that is a question mark in the right hand and a reversed question mark in the left hand.

<P>HAVE-NONE - (2h)[B], POs > signer move upwards past mouth and swing upwards and apart while mouth blows on hands as they pass.

<P>DEFINITE - DECIDE with a sudden motion.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - Like the sign INSIDE held against the chest.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Paraphrased from the Rambam (Maimonides), translated by Jonathan Baker.

<DL>
<P><DT>May the Living God be magnified and praised.
	<DD>Who exists, and whose existence is not limited by time.
<DT>One, and there is no unity like His Unity.
	<DD>Concealed, nor is there an end to His Unity.</DL>

<DL><P><DT>He has no form of a body, nor is He a body.
	<DD>It is not arranged around His holiness.
<DT>Preceding every created thing,
	<DD>First, and there is nothing prior to His Priority.</DL>
	
<DL><P><DT>As Master of the Universe to every formed being.
 	<DD>He teaches His Greatness and Sovereignty.
 <DT>The flow of His prophecy is His gift.
	 <DD>To men of His special, glorious nation.</DL>
<DL>
<P><DT>There has not risen another in Israel like Moses
	 <DD>A prophet and one who tells clearly his visions
 <DT>A Torah of truth did the Almighty give to His nation.
	 <DD>By the hand of His prophet [Moses], faithful to His house.</DL>
<DL>
<P><DT>God will not exchange nor retract.
 	<DD>His religion forever. Not even He.
 <DT>He observes and knows our secrets.
 	<DD>forecasting consequences from their antecedents.</DL>
<DL>
<P><DT>He grants Man loving kindness according to his deeds.
