<P><B>Refrain</B>: We come to share our story. We come to break the breead. We  come to know our rising from the dead.

<P>1. We come as your people. We come as your own. United with each other, love finds a home. 

<P>2. We are called to heal the broken, to be hope for the poor. We are called to feed the hungry at our door. 

<P>3. Bread of life and cup of promise, In this meal we all are one. In our dying and our rising, may your kingdom come. 

<P>4. You will lead and we shall follow. You will be the breath of life; living water, we are thirsting for your light. 

<P>5. We will live and sing your praises. "Alleluiah" is our song. May we live in love and peace our whole life long.
