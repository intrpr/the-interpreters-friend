<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. The day of resurrection! Earth, spread the news abroad;
<BR>The Paschal feast of gladness, the Paschal feast of God.
<BR>From death to life eternal, from earth to heaven's height,
<BR>Our Savior Christ has brought us, the glorious Lord of Light.

<P>2. Our hearts be free from evil, that we may see aright
<BR>The Savior resurrected in his eternal light,
<BR>And hear his message plainly, delivered calm and clear:
<BR>"Rejoice with me in triumph; Be glad and do not fear."

<P>3. His love is everlasting; His mercies never cease;
<BR>The resurrected Savior, will all our joys increase.
<BR>He'll keep us in his favor, supply the holy grace
<BR>to all his pilgrim people who seek his heavenly place.

<P>4. Now let the heavens be joyful, and earth the song begin.
<BR>The whole world keep high triumph, and all that is therein.
<BR>Let all things in creation their notes of gladness blend,
<BR>For Christ the Lord is risen, our joy that hath no end.
