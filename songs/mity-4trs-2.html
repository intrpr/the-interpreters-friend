<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. A mighty fortress is our God,
<BR>A sword and shield victorious;
<BR>He breaks the cruel oppressor's rod
<BR>And wins salvation glorious.
<BR>The old satanic foe
<BR>Has sworn to work us woe.
<BR>With craft and dreadful might
<BR>He arms himself to fight.
<BR>On earth he has no equal.

<P>2. No strength of ours can match his might.
<BR>We would be lost, rejected.
<BR>But now a champion comes to fight,
<BR>Whom God himself elected.
<BR>You ask who this may be?
<BR>The Lord of hosts is he,
<BR>Christ Jesus, mighty Lord,
<BR>God's only Son, adored.
<BR>He holds the field victorious.
				              
<P>3. Though hordes of devils fill the land
<BR>All threatening to devour us,
<BR>We tremble not, unmoved we stand;
<BR>They cannot overpower us.
<BR>Let this world's tyrant rage;
<BR>In battle we'll engage.
<BR>His might is doomed to fail;
<BR>God's judgment must prevail!
<BR>One little word subdues him.

<P>4. God's Word forever shall abide,
<BR>No thanks to foes, who fear it;
<BR>For God himself fights by our side
<BR>With weapons of the Spirit.
<BR>Were they to take our house,
<BR>Goods, honor, child, or spouse,
<BR>Though life be wrenched away,
<BR>They cannot win the day.
<BR>The Kingdom's ours forever!
