<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I don't have all the words. If anyone could send them to <A HREF="MAILTO:dbartzur@earthlink.net">me</A>, I would be most grateful.

<P>1. Come, thou fount of every blessing, 
<BR>Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; 
<BR>Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
<BR>Call for songs of loudest praise.
<BR>...
<BR>...
<BR>Teach us ever to be faithful
<BR>...

<P>2. Come thou fount of every measure. 
<BR>Lift our eyes to what may come.
<BR>See the lion and the lamb... 
<BR>Hear the cries of war fall silent;  
<BR>Feel our love glow like the sun; 
<BR>When we all serve one another, 
<BR>Then our heaven is begun.

<P>3. Come thou font of inspiration.
<BR>Let our hearts....  
<BR>...
<BR>... 
<BR>Help us bind ourselves in union. 
<BR>Help our hands tell of our love.
<BR>...
<BR>...
