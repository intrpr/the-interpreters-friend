<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>||: My Jesus, My Savior
<BR>Lord there is none like You
<BR>All of my days, I want to praise
<BR>The wonders of Your mighty love
<BR>My Comfort, My Shelter
<BR>Tower of refuge and strength
<BR>Let every breath, all that I am
<BR>Never cease to worship You

<P>Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing. 
<BR>Power and majesty, praise to the King.
<BR>Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
<BR>At the sound of Your name.
<BR>I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
<BR>Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand
<BR>Nothing compares to the promise I have in You! :||
