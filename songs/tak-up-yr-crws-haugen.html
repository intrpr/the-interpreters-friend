<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>CROSS - [C], PO away, FO up, traces cross by moving down, then across. 

<P>PUT-ON-SHOULDER - (2h)[C] grap imaginary cross at side and sling it over the shoulder. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>GRIEF - (2h)[S] twist at heart.

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>LOSE'expansively' - Execute the sign slowly and floridly.

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process. 

<P>LEAD-TO - Same sign as LEAD but I add the "-TO" to show the function of the sign in this sentence. 

<P>THAT'S-ALL - FINISH with the mouthing "that's all".

<P>#BACK-TO-you - (2h)[B], POs > signer, FOs up, move > signer while changing to (2h)[C] and (2h)[K].

<P>DISCIPLE - D-FOLLOW AGENT.

<P>#GO - [G], PO > NDS, FO away, moves > DS while closing to an [O^].

<P>FOX - [F], PO > NDS< FO up, twists at nose. 

<P>FLY-IN-AIR - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and hands flap like wings while showing the path of the flight.

<P>NEST - [bO^] represents beak and is stuck into side opening of [C].</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/N/W2477.htm">ASL browser - nest</A>.

<P>SECOND A-D-A-M - The concept is from the Hebrew "ben Adam" meaning the son of Adam. Adam can mean "man" but SON FROM MAN does not convey the concept that "[for] as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive."

<P>HAVE-NONE - (2h)[B], POs > signer move upwards past mouth and swing upwards and apart while mouth blows on hands as they pass.

<P>FAREWELL - Touch FT of [B] to mouth and then (2h)[B^], POs away, FOs up, flutter FTs as they move to the side as if saying goodbye to a circle of friends. 

<P>PAUSE - [X], PO down, FO away, curls around the index finger of [1], PO down, FO > DS, and DH lifts the NDH slightly.

<P>RULE - CONTROL.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>POWERFUL - [C] or [5:] brings FTs rapidly to the ND biceps.

<P>ALL - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A>

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly.

<P>QM - QM - [1], PO away, FO up, traces the shape of a question mark curling and uncurling the fingers once.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><U>Refrain:</U> Deny yourself, take up your cross and follow me. 
<BR>Deny yourself, take up your cross and follow. 
<BR>Through grief and fear, through pain and loss, come follow me. 
<BR>Deny yourself, take up your cross and follow.

<P>1. If you try to save your life, you will lose it; 
<BR>all your striving comes to nothing in the end. 
<BR>Offer up your life to me and let me use it, 
<BR>and I will give your life to you again. 

<P>2. (spoken) As they were going along the road, a man said to Jesus, "I will follow you wherever you go." And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." Another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell at home." Jesus said to him, "No on who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the Reign of God." 

<P>3. And if you should gain the world in all its glory, 
<BR>all the power and the riches and the fame, 
<BR>when you face the day of death, what is your story? 
<BR>And what becomes of all that you have claimed. 

<P>(After refrain) Deny yourself, take up your cross and follow.
