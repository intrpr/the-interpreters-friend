<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. All that I counted as gain,
<BR>now I consider as loss.
<BR>Empty and worthless to me,
<BR>in the light of the love of the Lord. 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> What more could bring us hope than to know the pow’r of his life?
<BR>What more could bring us peace than to share in his suff’ring and death?
<BR>What more could be our final wish than to live in the love of the Lord?

<P>2. Riches and honors will fade,
<BR>earthly delight disappear.
<BR>Fade like the grass of the field,
<BR>in the light of the love of the Lord. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. Silver and gold have I none,
<BR>no land to count as my home.
<BR>Yet wealth beyond measure I own,
<BR>in the light of the love of the Lord. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>4. Faith is the wealth I possess,
<BR>finding its souce in my God.
<BR>Faith in the promise of Christ,
<BR>is my life and my love of the Lord. <B>Refrain</B>
