<P>1 & 5. We walk by faith, and not by sight. No gracious words we hear of him who spoke as none e'er spoke, but we believe him near.

<P>2. We may not touch his hands and side, nor follow where he trod; yet in his promise we rejoice and cry "My Lord and God!"

<P>3. Help then, O Lord, our unbelief, and may our faith abound, to call on you when you are near, and seek where you are found.

<P>4. That when our life of faith is done in realms of clearer light we may behold you as you are in full and endless sight.
