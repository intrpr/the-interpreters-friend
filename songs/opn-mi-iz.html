<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Open my eyes, Lord. Help me to see your face. Open my eyes Lord. Help me to see.

<P>2. Open my ears, Lord. Help me to hear your voice. Open my ears, Lord. Help me to hear.

<P>3. Open my heart, Lord. Help me to love like you. Open my heart, Lord. Help me to love.

<P>4. And the first shall be last, and our eyes are opened, and we'll hear like never before. And we'll speak in new ways, and we'll see God's face
in places we've never known.
