<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Holy God, we praise Thy Name;
<BR>Lord of all, we bow before Thee!
<BR>All on earth Thy scepter claim,
<BR>All in Heaven above adore Thee;
<BR>Infinite Thy vast domain,
<BR>Everlasting is Thy reign.

<P>2. Hark! the loud celestial hymn
<BR>Angel choirs above are raising,
<BR>Cherubim and seraphim,
<BR>In unceasing chorus praising;
<BR>Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
<BR>Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

<P>3. Lo! the apostolic train
<BR>Join the sacred Name to hallow;
<BR>Prophets swell the loud refrain,
<BR>And the white robed martyrs follow;
<BR>And from morn to set of sun,
<BR>Through the Church the song goes on.

<P>4. Holy Father, Holy Son,
<BR>Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
<BR>While in essence only One,
<BR>Undivided God we claim Thee;
<BR>And adoring bend the knee,
<BR>While we own the mystery.
