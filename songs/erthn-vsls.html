<BR>one treasure only; the Lord the Christ, 
<BR>in earthen vessels. 

<P>1. Light has shone in our darkness. 
<BR>God has shone in our hearts, 
<BR>with the light of the glory 
<BR>of Jesus, the Lord. 

<P>2. He has chosen the lowly 
<BR>who are small in this world; 
<BR>in this weakness is glory 
<BR>in Jesus, the Lord.
