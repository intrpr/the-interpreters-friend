<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. On this day earth shall ring 
<BR>with the song children sing 
<BR>to the Lord, Christ our King, 
<BR>born on earth to save us; 
<BR>him the Father gave us. 

<P><B>Refrain:</B>Id-e-o-o-o, id-e-o-o-o, id-e-o, gloria in excelsis Deo!

<P>2. His the doom, ours the mirth; 
<BR>when he came down to earth, 
<BR>Bethlehem saw his birth; 
<BR>ox and ass beside him 
<BR>from the cold would hide him. 

<P>3. God's bright star, o'er his head, 
<BR>Wise Men three to him led; 
<BR>kneel they low by his bed, 
<BR>lay their gifts before him, 
<BR>praise him and adore him. 

<P>4. On this day angels sing; 
<BR>with their song earth shall ring, 
<BR>praising Christ, heaven's King, 
<BR>born on earth to save us; 
<BR>peace and love he gave us.
