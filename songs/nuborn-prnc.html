<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In a town called Bethlehem, in a stable by an inn, 
<BR>A child was born to Mary and to Joseph without sin. 
<BR>But the world seemed not to notice, and the world seemed not to care. 
<BR>But the gift God gave to us that night is the gift that's sleeping there.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Oh children come and see how God's gift  is shining bright. <BR>It's a gift for you and me that was given this night. 
<BR>Look upon the newborn baby and watch o'er him as he sleeps. 
<BR>It's the gift of Christmas joy he brings. 'Tis the newborn prince of peace.

<P>2. Oh the beasts all looked at him, but they did not understand. 
<BR>But the angels sang around him there: voices calling though the land. 
<BR>Then the shepherds came to praise him, and they fell upon their knees, 
<BR>For they knew what lay before them there: 'twas the newborn prince of peace.
