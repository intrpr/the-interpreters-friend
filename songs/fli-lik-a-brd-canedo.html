<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> MY SOUL FLY IDEA-LIKE BIRD TO <U>THE</U>-rt LORD.
<BR>LIKE EAGLE, <U>ME</U> WANT TAKE-OFF.
<BR>MAYBE JOURNEY FAR-AWAY MY HOME,
<BR>BUT <U>ME</U> KNOW LORD WITH <U>ME</U> ALWAYS.

<P>1. GOD, <U>YOU</U>-rt KNOW <U>ME</U> DEEP INSIDE-SELF:
<BR>WHAT <U>ME</U> LOOK-FORWARD, WHAT <U>ME</U> VISUALIZE.
<BR>SOMETIMES THINK-ABOUT, SOMETIMES FEAR.
<BR>SOMETIMES HAPPY, SOMETIMES TEAR.
<BR>GOD <U>YOU</U>-rt WITH <U>ME</U> TRUE-BIZ.

<P>2. <U>ME</U> ESCAPE YOUR-rt LOVE NEVER.
<BR><U>ME</U> HIDE, GOD FIND <U>ME</U> EASY.
<BR>ALL-DAY, ALL-NIGHT, 
<BR>GOD KNOW* <U>ME</U> WHERE.
<BR>GOD <U>YOU</U>-rt WITH <U>ME</U> TRUE-BIZ.

<P>3. HAPPEN <U>ME</U> DEPRESSED, AFRAID.
<BR>HAPPEN <U>ME</U> DISCONNECT MY GOD.
<BR>YOUR-rt HANDS EXTEND-DOWN TO <U>ME</U> SOFT-HEARTED.
<BR>AND <U>ME</U> KNOW <U>YOU</U>-rt UNDERSTAND.
<BR>GOD <U>YOU</U>-rt WITH <U>ME</U> TRUE-BIZ.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> FLY - (2h)[B] cross at wrists and hands flap like wings while showing the path of the flight.

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>TAKE-OFF - Like DEVELOP but moves quickly and abruptly with a "po". 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern.

<P>TEAR - [X] scratches downward slightly on face under eye.

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist.

<P>EXTEND-DOWN - Mime God stretching down his hands from above. 

<P>SOFT-HEARTED - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^] but hands close to heart.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Fly like a bird to the Lord, my soul.
<BR>I want to soar like an eagle.
<BR>Though I may journey far away from home,
<BR>I know I'll never be alone.

<P>1. O God, you know who I am.
<BR>You know my hopes and my dreams.
<BR>In my pondering and fears,
<BR>in my joy and in my tears,
<BR>O God, your presence is real.

<P>2. Where can I run from your love?
<BR>Where can I hide from my God?
<BR>From the dawn of morning's light
<BR>to the darkness of the night,
<BR>O God, your presence is real.

<P>3. When I am down and afraid,
<BR>when I am falling away,
<BR>you extend a gentle hand,
<BR>and I know you understand.
<BR>O God, your presence is real.
