<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>JOY - Start with the sign STAND and repeatedly and rapidly raise and lower the DH while curling the FT to show a person jumping.

<P>POUR-IN-CUP = NDH [C] acts as a cup and DH [A dot] acts as the neck of a bottle.  

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>SCADS-OF - (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, move forward to show many things.

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A>

<P>GIFT-TO - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, nod downwards at wrist to show that something is given as a gift. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Let us talents and tongues employ,
<BR>reaching out with a shout of joy:
<BR>bread is broken, the wine is poured,
<BR>Christ is spoken and seen and heard.
<BR>Jesus lives again; earth can breathe again.
<BR>Pass the Word around: loaves abound!

<P>2. Christ is able to make us one,
<BR>at his table he set the tone,
<BR>teaching people to live to bless,
<BR>love in word and in deed express.
<BR>Jesus lives again; earth can breathe again.
<BR>Pass the Word around: loaves abound!

<P>3. Jesus calls us in, sends us out
<BR>bearing fruit in a world of doubt,
<BR>gives us love to tell, bread to share:
<BR>God (Immanuel) everywhere!
<BR>Jesus lives again; earth can breathe again.
<BR>Pass the Word around: loaves abound!
