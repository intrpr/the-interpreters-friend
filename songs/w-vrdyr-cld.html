<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> PAH - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>BLOSSOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together.

<P>EYES-SCAN-HORIZON - (2h)[V], POs down, FOs away, scan from NDS to DS with beatific facial expression.

<P>DRAWN-BY-SCENT - [5^], POs > NDS, FO up, starts at NDS of body just under nose, moves > DS while closing to [O^], and head follows slightly as if drawn by the fragrance.

<P><U>THEY</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>ABUNDANCE-ON-TREE - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, alt. move forward to show many fruit on the trees.

<P>ARCHWAY - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, start above head with palms overlapping and move down towards sides outlining an arch with wg.

<P>trees-SWAY - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands are held side by side and sway side to side as if it were windy.  

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>With verdure clad the fields appear 
<BR>delightful to the ravished sense; 
<BR>by flowers sweet and gay
<BR>enhanced is the charming sight.
<BR>Here vent their fumes the fragrant herbs; 
<BR>here shoots the healing plant. 
<BR>By load of fruits the expanded boughs are pressed; 
<BR>to shady vaults are bent the tufty groves; 
<BR>the mountain’s brow is crowned with closed wood.
