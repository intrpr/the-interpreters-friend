<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.  

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>JERUSALEM - [B with thumbs flush with other fingers but not folded into palm], touches mouth and then pronates.

<P>AGAIN-AND-AGAIN - Repeat AGAIN with a circular motion.

<P><P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>FORTRESS - (2h)[S] are held in the same position as TABLE. DS arm strikes NDS arm from above, then NDS arm rises and strikes DS arm from above.

<P>WELL-ESTABLISHED - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down.

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A>

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A>

<P>COLLAPSE - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, interlace fingers and then bring knuckles downwards. 

<P>RAISE-FROM-COLLAPSE - (2h)[5:], POs down, interlace fingers and then bring knuckles upwards. 

<P>GO-AWAY - [5^], PO > signer, FO up, moves away while closing to [O^].

<P>TOUCHED - [open 8] strikes heart with middle finger.

<P>HEART-BREAK (poetic sign) - (2h)[modified C] where the knuckles of each hand contact each other as well as the thumbs creating a valentine heart and then the hands break away, changing the POs to upwards for a more violent break.

<P>HEART-TOGETHER BIND-HEART - (2h)[modified C] where the knuckles of each hand contact each other as well as the thumbs creating a valentine heart + with the NDH kept in place, the DH [O^] wraps around the NDH as if both hands where there, representing the heart and they are being bound together again.

<P>DOT-HEAVEN - (2h)[5:], POs and FOs diagonally up, hands jab upwards as if dotting the sky with stars.

<P>PEACE"full sign" - (2h)[Bb], cross in front of mouth and descend diagonally (like QUIET), then hands clasp as in MARRY and then clasp again with hands reversed in dominance.

<P>GRAIN -  [X], PO up, rubs along ND forearm as if harvesting.

<P>(2h)SPEAKwg (2h)[4], cross at mout, wg and move forward.

<P>LOUD - Touch ear with index finger then (2h)[S], PO down, FO away, move antisymmetrically from side to side while exaggeratedly mouthing "pow". 

<P>TORNADO - (2h)[L], touch thumbs, NDH PO > signer, FO > DS,DH just the opposite. Index fingers curl twice at same time. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/t/tornado.swf">ASL Pro: Tornado.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P><B>Refrain</B>: O bless the Lord, my soul who heals the broken-hearted.

<P>1. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; chant praises to your God. The strength of God is your fortress sure, and blessed are your children.

<P>2. All praise to you, O gracious God; your goodness fills the earth. you raise anew Jerusalem, and gather all your lost ones.

<P>3. You heal the hurt and broken heart; you bind up every wound. You number all the stars of night and call each one by name.

<P>4. The peace of God shall be your hope; God's finest wheat, your food. The word of God fills all the earth, as rapid as the whirlwind.
