<P>1. Precious Lord take my hand
<BR>Lead me on, let me stand
<BR>I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
<BR>Through the storm, through the night
<BR>Lead me on to the light
<BR>Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

<P>2. When my way grows drear
<BR>precious Lord linger near
<BR>When my life is almost gone
<BR>Hear my cry, hear my call
<BR>Hold my hand lest I fall
<BR>Take my hand precious Lord,lead me home

<P>3. When the darkness appears and
<BR>the night draws near
<BR>And the day is past and gone
<BR>At the river I stand
<BR>Guide my feet, hold my hand
<BR>Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home
