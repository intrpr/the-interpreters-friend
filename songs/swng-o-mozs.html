<P><B>Refrain:</B> I will sing to the God who sets me free. Pharaoh's army  and his chariots God cast into the sea!

<P>1. The Lord is my strength, my protection and my shield; Pharaoh's army and his chariots God cast into the sea. Our God is a warrior whose name is "the Lord," God of might. God of victory!

<P>2. The brave and mighty, the pride of Pharaoh's army, God plunged to the bottom of the sea like a stone. The hand of the Lord is magnificent in power; the Lord has crushed our foes!

<P>3. O God who redeems, who delivers us from slavery, you set us on the mountain of your holy place. Your throne and your temple shall endure for all time; your reign shall never end!
