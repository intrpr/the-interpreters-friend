<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>STEP-BY-STEP - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DH is held ahead of NDH, then NDH leapfrogs over DH, and DH over NDH, with a slight pause after each step.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/P/W3047.htm">ASL browser - procedure</A>.
