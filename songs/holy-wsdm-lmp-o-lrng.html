<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Holy Wisdom, lamp of learning,
<BR>Bless the light that reason lends.
<BR>Teach us judgment as we kindle
<BR>Sparks of thought your Spirit sends.
<BR>Sanctify our search for knowledge
<BR>And the truth that sets us free.
<BR>Come illumine mind and spirit
<BR>Joined in deepest unity.

<P>2. Vine of truth, in you we flourish;
<BR>By your grace we learn and grow.
<BR>May the word of Christ among us
<BR>Shape our life, our search to know.
<BR>Joined to Christ in living, dying.
<BR>May we help the church convey
<BR>Witness to the saving gospel,
<BR>Bearing fruit of faith today.

<P>3. Holy God, the hope of nations,
<BR>Tune us toward your righteous will,
<BR>As the symphony of ages
<BR>Claims our best, our finest skill.
<BR>Shape our search for peace and justice
<BR>Through prophetic deed and word.
<BR>Christ, conduct us, set our rhythm,
<BR>That God's praise be ever heard.
