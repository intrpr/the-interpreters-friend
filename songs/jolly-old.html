<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Jolly old Saint Nicholas,
<BR>Lean your ear this way!
<BR>Don't you tell a single soul
<BR>What I'm going to say;
<BR>Christmas Eve is coming soon;
<BR>Now, you dear old man,
<BR>Whisper what you'll bring to me;
<BR>Tell me if you can.

<P>2. When the clock is striking twelve,
<BR>When I'm fast asleep,
<BR>Down the chimney broad and black,
<BR>With your pack you'll creep;
<BR>All the stockings you will find
<BR>Hanging in a row;
<BR>Mine will be the shortest one,
<BR>You'll be sure to know.

<P>3. Johnny wants a pair of skates;
<BR>Susy wants a dolly;
<BR>Nellie wants a story book;
<BR>She thinks dolls are folly;
<BR>As for me, my little brain
<BR>Isn't very bright;
<BR>Choose for me, old Santa Claus,
<BR>What you think is right.
