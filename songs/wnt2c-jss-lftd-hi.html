<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>We want to see Jesus lifted high,
<BR>A banner that flies across this land
<BR>That all men may see the truth and know
<BR>That He is the way to heaven (2x) 

<P>We want to see, we want to see,
<BR>We want to see Jesus lifted high (2x) 

<P>Step by step we're moving forward,
<BR>Little by little we're taking ground,
<BR>Every prayer a powerful weapon,
<BR>Strongholds come tumbling down,
<BR>And down, and down, and down.
