<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In night's deep silence clear a voice rings through: Rise up ye shepherds; God is born for you. Quickly go ye over. Seek where Bethlehem's star doth hover. Haste to greet your Lord, haste to greet your Lord!

<P>2. They went; they found him. Babe in manger lies. Signs which foretold him seen with wond'ring eyes; to their God in homage tender words of heartfelt greeting render songs of greatest joy, songs of greatest joy.

<P>3. Ah, welcome Saviour whom we've long desired for many long years. Man for thee aspired. Kings and prophets waited for thee. Thou this night to us unworthy, kingly dost appear, kingly dost appear.
