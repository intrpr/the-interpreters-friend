<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Sent forth by God's blessing, our true faith confessing, 
<BR>the people of God from this dwelling take leave. 
<BR>The supper is ended. Oh, now be extended
<BR>the fruits of this service in all who believe. 
<BR>The fruit of Christ's teaching, receptive souls reaching, 
<BR>shall blossom in action for God and for all.
<BR>His grace did invite us, his love shall unite us 
<BR>to work for God's kingdom and answer his call.

<P>2. With praise and thanksgiving to God ever-living 
<BR>the tasks of our everyday life we will face. 
<BR>Our faith ever sharing, in love ever caring, 
<BR>embracing the children of each tribe and race. 
<BR>With your feast you feed us, with your light now lead us, 
<BR>unite us as one in this life that we share. 
<BR>Then may all the living with praise and thanksgiving 
<BR>give honor to Christ and his name that we bear.
