<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Here in this place, new light is streaming, 
<BR>Now is the darkness vanished away. 
<BR>See, in this space, our fears and our dreamings, 
<BR>Brought here to you in the light of this day. 
<BR>Gather us in - the lost and forsaken, 
<BR>Gather us in - the blind and the lame. 
<BR>Call to us now, and we shall awaken, 
<BR>We shall arise at the sound of our name. 

<P>2. We are the young - our lives are a mystery, 
<BR>We are the old - who yearn for your face. 
<BR>We have been sung throughout all of history, 
<BR>Called to be light to the whole human race. 
<BR>Gather us in - the rich and the haughty,
<BR>Gather us in - the proud and the strong. 
<BR>Give us a heart so meek and so lowly, 
<BR>Give us the courage to enter the song. 

<P>3. Here we will take the wine and the water, 
<BR>Here we will take the bread of new birth. 
<BR>Here you shall call your sons and your daughters, 
<BR>Call us anew to be salt for the earth. 
<BR>Give us to drink the wine of compassion, 
<BR>Give us to eat the bread that is you. 
<BR>Nourish us well, and teach us to fashion
<BR>Lives that are holy and hearts that are true. 

<P>4. Not in the dark of buildings confining, 
<BR>Not in some heaven, light years away, 
<BR>But here in this place, the new light is shining; 
<BR>Now is the Kingdom, now is the day. 
<BR>Gather us in - and hold us forever, 
<BR>Gather us in - and make us your own. 
<BR>Gather us in - all peoples together, 
<BR>Fire of love in our flesh and our bone.
