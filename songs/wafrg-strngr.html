<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
<BR>While traveling through this world of woe.
<BR>Yet there’s no sickness, toil nor danger
<BR>In that bright world to which I go.
<BR>I’m going there to see my Father;
<BR>I’m going there no more to roam.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I’m only going over Jordan,
<BR>I’m only going over home.

<P>I know dark clouds will gather round me;
<BR>I know my way is rough and steep.
<BR>But golden fields lie out before me
<BR>Where God’s redeemed shall ever sleep.
<BR>I’m going there to see my mother,
<BR>She said she’d meet me when I come. <B>Refrain:</B>

<P>I’ll soon be free from every trial,
<BR>My body sleep in the churchyard;
<BR>I’ll drop the cross of self denial
<BR>And enter on my great reward.
<BR>I’m going there to see my Savior,
<BR>To sing His praise forevermore. <B>Refrain:</B>
