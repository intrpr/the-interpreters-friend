<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Take up your cross, the Savior said,
<BR>If you would my disciple be;
<BR>Take up your cross with willing heart
<BR>And humbly follow after me.

<P>2. Take up your cross, let not its weight
<BR>Fill your weak spirit with alarm;
<BR>His strength shall bear your spirit up,
<BR>And brace your heart and nerve your arm.

<P>3. Take up your cross, heed not the shame,
<BR>And let your foolish heart be still;
<BR>The Lord for you accepted death,
<BR>Upon a cross on Calvary's hill.

<P>4. Take up your cross then in his strength,
<BR>And calmly everyday danger brave,
<BR>It guides you to a better home,
<BR>And leads you to victory o'er the grave.

<P>5. Take up your cross and follow Christ,
<BR>Nor think 'til death to lay it down;
<BR>For only those who bear the cross
<BR>May hope to wear the glorious crown.
