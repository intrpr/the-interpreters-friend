<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Beyond the moon and stars, as deep as night,
<BR>So great our hunger, Lord, to see your light.
<BR>The sparrow finds her home beneath your wing,
<BR>So may we come to rest where angels sing.

<P>1. Our eyes have longed to see your loving face,
<BR>To live within your courts for all our days.

<P>2. Your roads have led us, Lord, 'cross desert sand.
<BR>We place our hopes and dreams within your hand.

<P>3. Upon our darkness, Lord, a light has shone.
<BR>You came to dwell with us in flesh and bone.

<P>4. With shining stars at night, and cloud by day,
<BR>you brought us here to see your love's display.

<P>5. When lifeâ€™s great journey ends, and day is done,
<BR>Then may our eyes behold your Holy One.
