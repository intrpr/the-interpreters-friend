<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BLESS - BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> I've given up on the position that you can't bless God. It's just used too much.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A> 

<P>PAY-OFF - [open 8] runs middle finger up palm (> wrist), changes to a [B], PO down, and then moves back across palm. 

<P>SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=67">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Sin.</A>

<P>COMPASSION - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^] but hands close to heart. 

<P>CROWN - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) place crown on head with large single movement. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/c/crown.swf">ASL Pro: Crown.</A> 

<P>BLOW-TOP - [5], PO down, FO away, strikes top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and rises up again, twisting DH at wrist.

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>.

<P>#BACK - (2h)[B], POs > sign, FOs up; the hands transition to a C and then a K while rushing towards the signer. 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>HUMAN - H-BODY.

<P>DUST - [C], PO away, FO up, moves from NDS to DS along dorsal (back hand) side of [B], PO down, FO > DS.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Bless the Lord, my soul, 
<BR>and bless God's holy name. 
<BR>Bless the Lord, my soul, 
<BR>who leads me into life.

<P>1. It is he who forgives all your guilt,
<BR>who heals everyone of your ills, 
<BR>who redeems your life from the grave, 
<BR>who crowns you with love and compassion.

<P>2. The Lord is compassion and love, 
<BR>slow to anger and rich in mercy. 
<BR>He does not treat us according to our sins, 
<BR>nor repay us according to our faults.

<P>3. As a father has compassion on his children, 
<BR>the Lord has pity on those who fear him; 
<BR>for he know of what we are made, 
<BR>he remembers that we are dust.
