<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> O God, you alone know our hunger. 
<BR>For you are our life and our bread. 
<BR>Come now and feed us, renew and receive us. 
<BR>For we are your people. On you we are fed.

<P>1. Bread for the broken, and wine to be shared. 
<BR>Your family is gathered, the kingdom is dared. 
<BR>We hold dear the promise that conquers our death, 
<BR>and open our hearts to new life from your breath.

<P>2. The gifts at this table are born from the land. 
<BR>The path of this meal now is led by your hand. 
<BR>Food for the weary, and bread for the weak, 
<BR>and wine for the voiceless ones yearning to speak.

<P>3. We come to this banquet to fashion your dream; 
<BR>the grace of your mercy, the world to redeem. 
<BR>We work and we labor for your reign to come, 
<BR>for it is your bread and wine we become.
