<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> CHERISH - (2h)[5:], hold FTs by the sides of the chin and move down while maintaining contact and closing to (2h)[S]. 

<P>FEAST - (2h)alt.EAT. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/f/feast.swf">ASL Pro: Feast.</A>

<P>POUR-INTO-CUP - [A] tips over as if pouring something into the [C] hand, which represents a cup.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P><U>THIS</U>-altar - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. In this case the altar is indexed assuming that the Host and sacramental wine are there. If they are elsewhere, index that place. 

<P>SPRINKLE-DOWN - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend from above with wg.

<P>ANYONE - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone". 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>water-SPRING - WATER + what looks like a single movement of GROW has the DH continue to move away like (1h)SPREAD, with the DH remaining a [C]. 

<P>PARALLEL - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, move forward. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/parallel.swf">ASL Pro: Parallel.</A> 

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Precious body, Precious Blood here in bread and wine.
<BR>Here the Lord prepares the feast divine.
<BR>Bread of Love is broken now; Cup of Life is poured.
<BR>Come, share the Supper of the Lord.

<P>1. This is the bread of God coming down from heaven, 
<BR>giving life to us, to all the world.

<P>2. "I am the living spring of eternal life;
<BR>you that drink from me shall not thirst again."

<P>3. "I am the bread of heaven giving life to you;
<BR>you that eat this bread shall never die."

<P>4. "All those who feed on me have their life in me,
<BR>as I have my life in the living God."

<P>5. All praise to you, O Christ, present in this feast,
<BR>in this bread we share in one life, one Lord.
