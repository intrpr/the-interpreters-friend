<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P><B>English:</B> We gather this hour as people of faith, with joys and sorrows, gifts and needs.  We light this beacon of hope, sign of our quest for truth and meaning in celebration of the life we share together.

<P>NOW+ WE PEOPLE WITH FAITH ASSEMBLE. (&lt;) SOME HAPPY, (>) SOME SAD. (&lt;) SOME SATISFIED, (>) SOME NEED++.  WE IGNITE LIGHT, REPRESENT HOPE.  PROOF WE GO-TOWARDS-GOAL (&lt;) TRUTH, (>) MEANING, WHILE WE CELEBRATE LIFE SHARE TOGETHER.  

<HR>

<P><B>English:</B> We extinguish this flame but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment.  These we carry in our hearts until we are together again.

<P>INDEX-chalice FLAME DISSOLVE, BUT NOT (1) LIGHT SHOW TRUTH, (2) NOT WARM COMMUNITY, (3) NOT PROMISE BURNING-INSIDE-SELF.  INDEX-3-ON-LIST WE CARRY-AROUND INSIDE-SELF UNTIL WE ASSEMBLE AGAIN. 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ASSEMBLE - (2h)[S], FO > signer, move > signer while opening to (2h)[5wg].  

<P>IGNITE - Looks like lighting a match by striking the NDH palm with DH [bX].  For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/b/bentshlicht.swf">ASL Pro: Bentshlicht.</A>

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>BURNING-INSIDE-SELF - Like FIRE but small and close to body.  

<P>The symbols (1), (2), and (3) are meant to show NDH [3] and DH pointing to first finger, second finger, and third finger to show "first on list of three" and so on.  INDEX-3-ON-LIST points to first through third finger to show all three items on the list.  

<P>CARRY-AROUND - (2h)[B], PO up, moves in circles.  

<P>INSIDE-SELF - Hold the FT of [C] against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.
