<P>1. This child of ours, this miracle - You have a dream and plan for it. You wash it clean. You cradle it. You bless it and You call it Yours: this child of ours, this child of Yours.

<P>2. This child of Yours, this miracle - reborn of Water and the Word. The Book of Life records its name. You smile and angels celebrate: this child of Yours, this child of ours.

<P>3. This child of ours, this miracle - whom Christ would die for, we may love and train and raise, and teach and praise, and watch the Spirit mold a life: this child or ours, this child of Yours.
