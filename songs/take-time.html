<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;
<BR>Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word.
<BR>Make friends of God’s children, help those who are weak,
<BR>Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.

<P>2. Take time to be holy, the world rushes on;
<BR>Spend much time in secret, with Jesus alone.
<BR>By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be;
<BR>Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

<P>3. Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide;
<BR>And run not before Him, whatever betide.
<BR>In joy or in sorrow, still follow the Lord,
<BR>And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word.

<P>4. Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul,
<BR>Each thought and each motive beneath His control.
<BR>Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
<BR>Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
