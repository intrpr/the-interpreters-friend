<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Signed by water, signed by ashes, secure in your love, O God.

<P>1. Have mercy on us, God in your compassion. Wipe out our offenses by your might. Wash away our guilt; make us worthy to walk your path in justice.

<P>2. My sinfulness is visible, ever before you. Against you alone I've transgressed. But in you is the mighty power of mercy; when I forgive, I am blest.

<P>3. Cleanse me of my sin and I'll be pure, O Lord. Wash me so I'm cleaner than snow. Let me hear the sounds of joy and gladness that only those forgiven ever know. 

<P>4. Create for me a clean heart, God of mercy. Renew a steadfast spirit in me. Cast me not out from your loving presence, that I may worship, sacrifice and sing. 

<P>5. O God, my heart and voice are raised to praise you. You are not pleased with sacrifice alone. My sacrifice: a contrite, humble spirit; I've heard your invitation: "Child, come home!"
