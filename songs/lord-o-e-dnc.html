<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
<BR>And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
<BR>And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth,
<BR>At Bethlehem I had my birth.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Dance, then, wherever you may be;
<BR>I am the Lord of the Dance, said he.
<BR>And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,
<BR>And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said he.

<P>2. I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
<BR>But they would not dance and they would not follow me;
<BR>I danced for the fishermen, for James and John;
<BR>They came to me and the dance went on. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. I danced on the sabbath when I cured the lame,
<BR>The holy people said it was a shame;
<BR>They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high;
<BR>And they left me there on a cross to die. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>4. I danced on a Friday and the sky turned black;
<BR>It’s hard to dance with the devil on your back;
<BR>They buried my body and they thought I’d gone,
<BR>But I am the dance and I still go on. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>5. They cut me down and I leapt up high,
<BR>I am the life that’ll never, never die;
<BR>I’ll live in you if you’ll live in me;
<BR>I am the Lord of the Dance, said he. <B>Refrain</B>
