<P>1. For all the saints, who from their labors rest,
<BR>Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
<BR>Thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blessed.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>2. Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might;
<BR>Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight;
<BR>Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>3. O blest communion, fellowship divine!
<BR>We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
<BR>All are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>4. And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
<BR>Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
<BR>And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<!--
<P>3. For the Apostles’ glorious company,
<BR>Who bearing forth the Cross o’er land and sea,
<BR>Shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee:
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>4. For the Evangelists, by whose blest word,
<BR>Like fourfold streams, the garden of the Lord,
<BR>Is fair and fruitful, be Thy Name adored.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>5. For Martyrs, who with rapture kindled eye,
<BR>Saw the bright crown descending from the sky,
<BR>And seeing, grasped it, Thee we glorify.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>6. O blest communion, fellowship divine!
<BR>We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
<BR>All are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>7. O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
<BR>Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
<BR>And win with them the victor’s crown of gold.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>8. And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
<BR>Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
<BR>And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>9, The golden evening brightens in the west;
<BR>Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;
<BR>Sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>10. But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
<BR>The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
<BR>The King of glory passes on His way.
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!

<P>11. From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest coast,
<BR>Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
<BR>And singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost:
<BR>Alleluia, Alleluia!-->
