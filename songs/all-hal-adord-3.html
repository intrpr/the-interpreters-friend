<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. All hail, adored Trinity!
<BR>all hail, eternal Unity!
<BR>O God the Father, God the Son,
<BR>and God the Spirit, ever One.

<P>2. To thee upon this holy day,
<BR>we offer up our thankful lay;
<BR>thou hearest in thy love's great wealth,
<BR>and praising thee is all our health.

<P>3. Three Persons praise we evermore,
<BR>our only God our hearts adore;
<BR>in thy sweet mercy ever kind
<BR>may we our sure protection find.

<P>4. O Trinity! O Unity!
<BR>Be present as we worship thee;
<BR>and with the songs that angels sing
<BR>unite the hymns of praise we bring.
