<P><B>Refrain</B>: Ubi caritas est vera: Deus ibi est.

<P>1. The love of Christ joins us together. Let us rejoice in him, and in our love and care for all, now love God in return.

<P>2. In true communion, let us gather. May all divisions cease and in their place be Christ the Lord, our risen Prince of Peace.

<P>3. May we who gather at this table to share the bread of life become a sacrament of love, your healing touch, O Christ.

<P>4. For those in need, make us your mercy, for those oppressed, your might. Make us, your Church, a holy sign of justice and new life.

<P>5. May we one day behold your glory and see you face to face, rejoicing with the saints of God to sing eternal praise.
