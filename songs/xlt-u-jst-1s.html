<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> WILDERNESS - COUNTRY SETTLE, NOT-YET. Where the second sign is (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend with several stops along the way.

<P>PREPARE - PLAN. 

<P>HIT* - conjunction meaning "unexpected but positive". 

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>FAIR'circle' - (2h)[B^] are held together like one of the positions of EQUAL, and hands move together in a horizontalk circle.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>RIGHTEOUS - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>SHAKE - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, shake hands left to right antisymmetrically.

<P>Y-GOD - Represents "Yahweh", a possible pronunciation of the ineffable name of God (Hebrew).

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A> 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>GONE - [5^], PO > face, FO up, moves downwards and closes to a [O^], while the NDH is a [B], PO > singer, FO > DS held further away and in neutral space.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>VIRGIN - [V], PO away, FO up, brushes against DS of chin twice. 

<P>GIVE-BIRTH - S-ENTER. Not to be confused with BORN. The child is BORN, the mother GIVE[s]-BIRTH. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Prepare in the wilderness a highway for our God! 
<BR>Let mountains and hills be made low; 
<BR>let the lowlands and valleys be raised! 
<BR>For the Lord reveals His power; 
<BR>the Lord comes as a Lamb; the Lord is born as a man!

<P><B>Antiphon:</B> Exult you just ones in the Lord.
<BR>Let hills and mountains be shaken by your song, 
<BR>for the Lord is among us in our land.

<P>2. Yahweh, the Holy One, says this: 
<BR>"Behold I make all things new. 
<BR>A new day has dawned for the nations of the earth, 
<BR>Let all creation rejoice!" 

<P>3. Yahweh, the Holy One, says this: 
<BR>"I myself give you a sign: 
<BR>A virgin conceives and bears you a Son. 
<BR>His name: Emanuel!"
