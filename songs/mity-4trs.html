<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B>  

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>FORTRESS - (2h)[S], POs down, FOs &gt;&lt;, strike the whole length of the forearms together like TABLE then DH is held under NDH and the arms strike again. 

<P>MIGHTY - (2h)[S], POs > back of signer, FOs up, are held at NDS and fists descend, then repeat at DS.

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below. 

<P>COLLAPSE - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, interlace fingers and then bring knuckles downwards.  

<P>ANCIENT - OLD but hand descends in a wavy pattern as if the beard is very long.

<P>SCREWED-UP - (2h)[5:], FOs away, DH is held high, PO down at its side and NDH is held low, PO up at its side. Both hands interchange PO and levels while moving slightly > DS.

<P>CRAFTINESS - (2h)[O^] are held at end of mouth and arc downwards while changing to (2h)[A], as if twirling a handlebar moustache the way villains did in silent movies. 

<P>CONQUER - (2h)[S], DPO > NDS, NDPO down, FOs away, are held with DH on top of NDH and DH strikes NDH wrist on dorsal side (from above) and nods while staying at wrist. 

<P>SAVIOR - SAVE AGENT.

<P>THAT-ONE - THAT ends with the index finger pointing.
 
<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>alt.GIFT-TO"each" - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs > the recipents, hands move together from NDS to DS. 

<P>SALVATION - SAVE.

<P>CLOUD - Like CLASS, but FTs flutter.

<P>JUSTICE - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle. 

<P>UPRIGHT - Elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, is struck against the fingers of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE.

<P>FOLD - Elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, is held against the dorsal side (back hand) of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE, and the DH swivels down with the elbow held in place.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1a. A mighty fortress is our God: A bulwark never failing.
<BR>Our helper he amid the flood Of mortal ills prevailing.
<BR>For still our ancient foe Doth seek to work us woe;
<BR>His craft and power are great, And armed with cruel hate.
<BR>On earth is not his equal.

<P>2a. Did we in our own strength confide, Our striving would be losing.
<BR>Were not the Savior on our side: The man of God's own chosing.
<BR>Dost ask who that might be? Christ Jesus, it is he.
<BR>Lord Sabaoth, his name, From age to age the same,
<BR>And he must win the battle.

<P>1b. A mighty fortress is our God, Our stronghold and protection. 
<BR>He is our hope, our friend, our guide, The giver of salvation.
<BR>Our Lord is God alone. He made the world his own.
<BR>He speaks and winds obey. He rules 'til endless day.
<BR>His truth abides forever.

<P>2b. Great and eternal is our God: The god of all creation.
<BR>He made the sun to shine through cloud. He formed earth's deep foundation.
<BR>Rejoice and praise his name. His goodness will remain.
<BR>With strong and guiding hand, Firm shall his justice stand.
<BR>His promise is eternal.
