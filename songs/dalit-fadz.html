<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Daylight fades in days when deathless
<BR>Light has robbed earth's night of fear; 
<BR>On the edge of all our twilights
<BR>Easter's angel shall appear; 
<BR>When hearts broken by believing 
<BR>Count their faith and hope as dead, 
<BR>Christ will greet them in each other 
<BR>And in breaking of the bread. 

<P>2. Wondrous mystery of love's giving! 
<BR>Our forgiving Father's Son. 
<BR>Crushed in sorrow, raised to glory 
<BR>Death had conquered; life has won! 
<BR>Once in silence he submitted, 
<BR>Now earth sings to him, our King; 
<BR>Fear will ever flee defeated 
<BR>When a heart in love can sing!

<P>3. O Lord Jesus, risen Savior, 
<BR>Hear our joyful hymn of praise; 
<BR>Grant a season of salvation, 
<BR>Peace, and joy these Easter days. 
<BR>To our Father and the Spirit 
<BR>Equal praises ever be; 
<BR>Born again, we sing God's goodness
<BR>Now and through eternity.
