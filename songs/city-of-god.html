<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Awake from your slumber! Arise from your sleep! 
<BR>A new day is dawning for all those who weep.
<BR>The people in darkness have seen a great light. 
<BR>The Lord of our longing has conquered the night.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Let us build the city of God. 
<BR>May our tears be turned into dancing!
<BR>For the Lord, our light and our love 
<BR>Has turned the night into day!

<P>2. We are sons of the morning; we are daughters of day. 
<BR>The One who has loved us has brightened our way.
<BR>The Lord of all kindness has called us to be
<BR>A light for his people to set their hearts free. 

<P>3. God is light, in Him there is no darkness.
<BR>Let us walk in his light, his children one and all.
<BR>O comfort my people; make gentle your words.
<BR>Proclaim to my city the day of her birth. 

<P>4. O city of gladness, now lift up your voice!
<BR>Proclaim the good tidings that all may rejoice!
