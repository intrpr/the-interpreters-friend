<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. If I speak with the tongues of the earth, if the angels fill my mouth, yet do not have love, I am but a sound. If I prophesy and understand all things, if mountains shake by my faith, without love I am nothing at all.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Love is patient; love is kind. Love rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, it hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.

<P>2. If I give away everything I own, give my body to be burned, yet do not have love, I gain nothing more. Prophecies will cease; tongues will be silent. Knowledge will be no more, the partial pass away.

<P>3. When I was a child, I talked, thought, and live like a child. But now that I have grown, I have put these things aside. My knowledge is imperfect now, then I'll know as I am known: that faith, hope and love remain, and the greatest of these is love.
