<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>STRIVE-FOR - Hands are oriented like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle as if trying to get to the goal, but not yet successful. 

<P>FROM-NOW-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DHFT touches knuckle side of NDHFT and moves away in a downward arc. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1382.htm">ASL browser - from now on</A>.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> That there may be bread, that there may be 
<BR>joy for all humanity to share with gratitude: 
<BR>let this be our prayer, and may each child of earth 
<BR>long for a freedom that will flourish in all lands.

<P>1. Simple is the truth that our love cannot be real
<BR>unless we choose to bless each other as blessing we have known.

<P>2. Still, the long night falls and yet for some, deep hunger cries 
<BR>as their tears become their bread: their hope too soon may die.

<P>3. Lord, what should I do to have eternal life? 
<BR>Love the God who lives within you and your neighbor as yourself.

<P>4. Lord, who is my neighbor? The one whose struggle 
<BR>and whose needs you overlook, while your own comfort you secure.

<P>5. Grateful for our life, can we be free to thirst and work 
<BR>for the planting and the harvest of Kingdom's life in all?

<P>6. At this table of thanksgiving we are fed 
<BR>with the life of Jesus Risen, in whom our hope is born.

<P>7. Sign of God's deep love is this banquet of new life:
<BR>know the presence of the Holy, in spirit and in truth.
