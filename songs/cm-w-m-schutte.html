<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SCADS-OF - (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, move forward to show many things. 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>GRAIN - [X], PO up, rubs along ND forearm as if harvesting. 

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A> 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>GO-WITH - (2h)[A] press palms together and move forward. 

<P>EXHAUSTED - TIRED + [V], PO up, FO > NDS, is drawn with effort across the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. 

<P>WORN-OUT - (2h)[A], palms together, FO away, hands separate while changing to (2h)[5:], POs up, FOs away.

<P>THROW-FROM-BOWL - Curl ND arm as if holding a large flat bowl and use your DH to scatter the seed. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. The fields are high and summer's days are few;
<BR>green fields have turned to gold. 
<BR>The time is here for the harvesting,
<BR>for gathering home into barns.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> The harvest is plenty: laborers are few.
<BR>Come with me into the fields.
<BR>Your arms may grow weary; your shoes will wear thin.
<BR>Come with me into the fields.

<P>2. The seeds were sown by other hands than yours;
<BR>nurtured and cared for they grow.
<BR>But those who have sown will not harvest them;
<BR>the reaping will not be their care.
