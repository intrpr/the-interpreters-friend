<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We are all hungry people, 
<BR>We need shelter and strength.
<BR>We are one in our hurting, 
<BR>We are one in our pain.
<BR>In our suff'ring and sadness,
<BR>We are saved by the grace
<BR>Of the power and the Spirit 
<BR>That is here in this place.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> We are gathered at table 
<BR>As one in the Lord.
<BR>We are gathered as people  
<BR>Who are living the Word.
<BR>Our hearts and our spirits 
<BR>Are nurtured by grace.
<BR>It is Jesus who fills us. 
<BR>He is here in this place.

<P>2. All our lives are a Myst'ry;
<BR>We see not where they lead.
<BR>We are asked now to trust you
<BR>And we know we must believe.
<BR>As our feet become Christ's feet,
<BR>We go forth with the grace
<BR>Of the power and the Spirit 
<BR>That is here in this place.

<P>3. Though the world may tell us 
<BR>To look at ourselves,
<BR>We reach out to another
<BR>Where suffering dwells. 
<BR>As our hands become 
<BR>Christ's hands,
<BR>We are healed by the grace
<BR>Of the power and the Spirit 
<BR>That is here in this place.

<P>4. In the bread that is broken
<BR>Is the Christ that restores. 
<BR>As we take, now receive him,
<BR>We find love evermore.
<BR>As the bread becomes Body, 
<BR>We are filled with the grace
<BR>Of the power and the Spirit 
<BR>That is here in this place.
