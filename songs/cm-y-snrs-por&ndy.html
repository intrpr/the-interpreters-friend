<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
<BR>Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
<BR>Jesus ready stands to save you,
<BR>Full of pity, love and power.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I will arise and go to Jesus,
<BR>He will embrace me in His arms;
<BR>In the arms of my dear Savior,
<BR>O there are ten thousand charms.

<P>2. Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,
<BR>God's free bounty glorify;
<BR>True belief and true repentance,
<BR>Every grace that brings you nigh. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
<BR>Lost and ruined by the fall;
<BR>If you tarry till you're better,
<BR>You will never come at all. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>4. View Him prostrate in the garden;
<BR>On the ground your Maker lies.
<BR>On the bloody tree behold Him;
<BR>Sinner, will this not suffice? <B>Refrain</B>

<P>5. Lo! th'incarnate God ascended,
<BR>Pleads the merit of His blood:
<BR>Venture on Him, venture wholly,
<BR>Let no other trust intrude. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>6. Let not conscience make you linger,
<BR>Not of fitness fondly dream;
<BR>All the fitness He requireth
<BR>Is to feel your need of Him. <B>Refrain</B>
