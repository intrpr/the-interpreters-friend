<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Led by the Spirit of our God, we go to fast and pray
<BR>With Christ into the wilderness; we join his paschal way.
<BR>"Rend not your garments, rend your hearts. Turn back your lives to me."
<BR>Thus says our kind and gracious God, whose reign is liberty.

<P>2. Led by the Spirit, we confront temptation face to face, 
<BR>And know full well we  must rely on God's redeeming grace.
<BR>On bread alone we cannot live, but nourished by the Word
<BR>We seek the will of God to do: this is our drink and food.

<P>3. Led by the Spirit, now draw near the waters of rebirth
<BR>With hearts that long to worship God in spirit and in truth.
<BR>"Whoever drinks the drink I give shall never thirst again."
<BR>Thus says the Lord who died for us, our Savior, kindred friend.

<P>4. Led by the Spirit, now sing praise to God the Trinity: 
<BR>The Source of Life, the living Word made flesh to set us free,
<BR>The Spirit blowing where it will to make us friends of God:
<BR>This mystery far beyond our reach, yet near in healing love.
