<P><A NAME="Introduction"><B>Introduction to this translation</B></CENTER>

<P>This is a translation into ASL of the Catholic Mass. To understand the glossing system used, go to the <a href="glws.html">Glossing system used for songs and ritual texts.</A> The following symbology is used to show who is speaking: <B>P</B> = priest, <B>L</B> = lector, <B>C</B> = congregation, <B>A</B> = all, and <B>N</B> = replace with the appropriate name. Each section is glossed independently and notes are offered so that the ASL translation can be compared with the English translation used in American Catholic churches. If you are interpreting for a Deaf person who is not familiar with the Catholic mass, you could sign YOUR-TURN when it is the congregation's turn to say something so that the Deaf consumer(s) can know that it is their turn to sign. It is, of course, their decision if they want to copy the interpreter's sign, sign it in the way they wish, or remain silent. 

<P>My choice is to spatialize Jesus on the left (since he is at the right hand of God and therefore on the left from our perspective), to put God the Father on the right, and the Holy Spirit in the middle. When God as a whole is meant, I spatialize Him in the middle. The notes on signs are cummulative, that is, if a sign is described in an earlier section, it is not described later. Try a search of the page if you don't find a description of the sign you need.

<P>Ideally, the priest, the choir director, and other relevant church workers should share texts with you that will be use for the service. You should be able to get the hymns and the music the choir and soloists will perform a week or so before the service. Some people who are responsible for the music are strangely territorial and may give you trouble, sadly. Explain to them as musical performers that there is a need to try and make the signed hymns look rhythmic and clarify any old-fashioned English and complex concepts as much as possible. If they cannot relate to this, go over their heads. The prayers of the faithful are usually printed out for the lector and should be available the same day. Ask if a second copy can be made for you. Some homilists (people who offer the sermon) may print out notes for themselves; ask them if you could have a copy to read shortly before the service and get there early in order to do so. The readings and other special liturgical units that may be added on special Holy Days are standard on a three-year cycle: A, B, and C. Know which cycle you are in and get a copy of the missal so that you can read it beforehand. For translations into glossed ASL (written in English to show which signs to use) of the various readings, see <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Signing-Scriptures-Starting-Interpreting-Readings/dp/1568545606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212917375&sr=1-1">Signing the Scriptures, Year A</A> or <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Signing-Scriptures-Starting-Interpreting-Readings/dp/1568545134/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212917375&sr=1-2">Signing the Scriptures, Year C.</A> Most of the readings have also been videotaped in ASL and can be purchased from <A HREF="../rlgn/chr.html#asl-bible">Deaf Missions.</A>

<P><B>A:</B> We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and our salvation, he came down from heaven: (All bow during the italicized lines) by the power of the Holy Spirit, was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified Pontius Pilate, he suffered, died and was buried. On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT IT: THIS IS MY BODY WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU. When supper was ended, he took the cup. Again he gave you thanks and praise, gave the cup to his disciples, and said: TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT: THIS IS THE CUP OF MY BLOOD, THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND EVERLASTING COVENANT. IT WILL BE SHED FOR YOU AND FOR ALL MEN SO THAT SINS ARE FORGIVEN. DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
