<P>My son, you are always with me, and all I have is yours. Can't you understand my joy when my lost and desperate boy comes home? So come in and break the bread, for your brother who was dead is alive. Your brother who was lost has been found. So

<P>||: God rejoices when the lost is found, when the poor and broken are gathered 'round. Oh the blest amazing grace, how sweet the sound. God rejoices when the lost is found. :||
