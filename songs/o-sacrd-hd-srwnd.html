<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O sacred head, surrounded
<BR>By crown of piercing thorn!
<BR>O bleeding head, so wounded,
<BR>Reviled and put to scorn!
<BR>Our sins have marred the glory
<BR>Of thy most holy face,
<BR>Yet angel hosts adore thee
<BR>And tremble as they gaze.

<P>2. I see thy strength and vigor
<BR>All fading in the strife,
<BR>And death with cruel rigor,
<BR>Bereaving thee of life;
<BR>O agony and dying!
<BR>O love to sinners free!
<BR>Jesus, all grace supplying,
<BR>O turn thy face on me.

<P>3. In this thy bitter passion,
<BR>Good Shepherd, think of me
<BR>With thy most sweet compassion,
<BR>Unworthy though I be:
<BR>Beneath thy cross abiding
<BR>For ever would I rest,
<BR>In thy dear love confiding,
<BR>And with thy presence blest.

<P>1a. O sacred head, surrounded
<BR>By crown of piercing thorn!
<BR>O bleeding head, so wounded,
<BR>Reviled and put to scorn!
<BR>Our sins have marred the glory
<BR>Of thy most holy face,
<BR>Yet angel hosts adore thee
<BR>And tremble as they gaze.

<P>2a. In this thy bitter passion,
<BR>Good Shepherd, think of me
<BR>With thy most sweet compassion,
<BR>Unworthy though I be:
<BR>Beneath thy cross abiding
<BR>For ever would I rest,
<BR>In thy dear love confiding,
<BR>And with thy presence blest.

<P>3a. What language shall I borrow
<BR>To thank you, dearest friend,
<BR>For this, your dying sorrow,
<BR>Your mercy without end?
<BR>Lord, make me yours forever,
<BR>A loyal servant true,
<BR>And let me never, never
<BR>Outlive my love for you.

<P>1b. O sacred head, surrounded
<BR>By crown of piercing thorn!
<BR>O bleeding head, so wounded,
<BR>Reviled and put to scorn!
<BR>No comeliness or beauty 
<BR>Thy wounded face betrays, 
<BR>Yet angel hosts adore thee
<BR>And tremble as they gaze.
 
<P>2b. O Love, all love transcending,
<BR>O Wisdom from on high!
<BR>O truth, unchanged, unchanging,
<BR>Surrendered up to die!
<BR>Was e'er a love so wondrous!
<BR>That from his heavenly throne
<BR>God should descend among us
<BR>To suffer for his own.

<P>3b. O Jesus, we adore thee,
<BR>Upon the cross our King!
<BR>We humbly bow before thee,
<BR>And of thy victory sing!
<BR>Thy cross is our salvation, 
<BR>Our hope from day to day,
<BR>Our peace and consolation
<BR>When life shall fade away.
