<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>There's a time and place, for everything.
<BR>There's a reason why, certain people meet.
<BR>There's a destination, for everyone.
<BR>What's the explanation, when we're done?

<P>All the summer nights spent wondering;
<BR>So many questions asked, but no one's answering.
<BR>Would it be okay if I left today?
<BR>Took my chances on what you said was wrong?

<P>I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret.
<BR>These years spent, so faded and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
<BR>I'll never regret these years.

<P>Now here i sit, so far away.
<BR>Remembering all our memories.
<BR>Its times like these that I miss you most,
<BR>Remembering when we were so close.

<P>I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, we'll never regret.
<BR>These years spent, so faded and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.

<P>We'll never forget the places we've been, you and i.
<BR>Our lives are slipping away.
<BR>Don't want to let time pass us by, byyyyyyy...

<P>I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret. 
<BR>These years....
<BR>spent, so faded and wreckless, 
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret...
<BR>I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
<BR>Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
