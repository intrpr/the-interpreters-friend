<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> OPEN-UP - (2h)[bO] are held at the sides of the eyes and open to (2h)[L]. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>POUR-OUT - (2h)[C] pour out an imaginary container. 

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder. 

<P>LOVING - LOVE++.

<P>MAGIC - (2h)[O^], hold out index fingers which describe a circle in the air symmetrically, starting together, rising, separating, etc., and end with the index fingers retracting back to (2h)[O^] and then open to (2h)[5^].

<P>BOND FALTER - (2h)[5] join together by forming (2h)[5] interlinked + (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs away, twist POs antisymmetrically so that the NDHPO is up and the DH PO is down and then vice versa.

<P>FADE - DISSOVE.

<P>LIVING - LIVE++. 

<P>STRAY - like the sign OFF-THE-POINT but the DH flicks index finger to one side and then to the other side; it's another way to sign the concept "sin".STRIVE-FOR-GOAL - Hands are oriented like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle as if trying to get to the goal, but not yet successful.

<P>OPPRESSION - DH [B], PO down, FO away, push down twice on [S], PO > DS, FO away.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Bread of life and cup of hope, we come as gift to you. Change our hearts; fill us with peace. Transform our lives anew.  Open our eyes so that we might see your prescence in one another. your life, poured out in love today, unites us all in you.

<P>2. Loving Lord, Creator God, open our eyes to see the good that live in each of us, that called the world to be. And when we fail to see the good, when friendships falter and crumble, give us the courage to forgive that we may live in peace.

<P>3. Living Word, O Son of God, your love shows us the way that we may live in harmony, and from you never stray. Wipe all oppression from our midst; give us a love for all people. your song of justice sing in us, to live for peace today.
