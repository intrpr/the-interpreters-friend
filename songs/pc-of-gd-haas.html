<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SOFT-HEARTED - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^].

<P>DON'T - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>KEEP-IN-MIND - Thumb of [A dot], PO away, touches temple and head ducks down slightly.

<P>GO-TOGETHER - (2h)[A] press palms together and move away. 

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.  

<P>THINK-ABOUT - Index finger circles temple.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Let your gentleness be known, so all may know the Lord is near. Do not worry; reach out to God in prayer. Stay with all that you have learned, and all that you have heard and seen, and the peace of God will be with you. 

<P>1. Whatever is true, whatever is just, all that is pure and pleasing and all that is worthy of praise; think on these things.

<P>2. The peace of God beyond all understanding will guard your hearts and guide your minds in Christ Jesus.
