<BR>The Lord is my refuge, guarding my life;
<BR>of whom should I be afraid?

<P>2. Only one thing I ask:
<BR>may I live in the house of my Lord.
<BR>I shall gaze on God's goodness all of my days;
<BR>I shall live in the shelter of God.

<P>3. I believe I shall see
<BR>the gooodness of God
<BR>in the land of the living.
<BR>Be strong, wait for the Lord.
