<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Lord, who at thy Eucharist didst pray
<BR>that all thy Church might be forever one,
<BR>grant us at every Eucharist to say
<BR>with longing heart and soul, "thy will be done."
<BR>O may we all one Bread, one Body be,
<BR>through this blest Sacrament of unity.

<P>2. For all thy Church, O Lord, we intercede;
<BR>make thou our sad divisions soon to cease;
<BR>draw us the nearer each to each, we plead,
<BR>by drawing all to thee, O Prince of Peace;
<BR>thus may we all one Bread, one Body be,
<BR>through this blest Sacrament of unity.

<P>3. We pray thee too for wanderers from thy fold;
<BR>O bring them back, good Shepherd of the sheep,
<BR>back to the faith which saints believed of old,
<BR>back to the Church which still that faith doth keep;
<BR>soon may we all one Bread, one Body be,
<BR>through this blest Sacrament of unity.

<P>4. So, Lord, at length when sacraments shall cease,
<BR>may we be one with all thy Church above,
<BR>one with thy saints in one unbroken peace,
<BR>one with thy saints in one unbounded love;
<BR>more bless√®d still, in peace and love to be
<BR>one with the Trinity in Unity.
