<P>Ding dong merrily on high,
<BR>In heav'n the bells are ringing:
<BR>Ding dong! verily the sky
<BR>Is riv'n with angel singing.
<BR>Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

<P>E'en so here below, below,
<BR>Let steeple bells be swungen,
<BR>And "Io, io, io!"
<BR>By priest and people sungen.
<BR>Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

<P>Pray you, dutifully prime
<BR>Your matin chime, ye ringers;
<BR>May you beautifully rime
<BR>Your evetime song, ye singers.
<BR>Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
