<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_Yourself_a_Merry_Little_Christmas">Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A> for a discussion of the two versions. I like Garland's better: it's more poignant and melancholy. Sinatra asks a writer to gladden his version up, and I think it's sappy.

<P><U>Sinatra version</U>:

<P>Have yourself a merry little Christmas
<BR>Let your heart be light.
<BR>From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.

<P>Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
<BR>Make the Yule-tide gay.
<BR>From now on, our troubles will be miles away.

<P>Here we are as in olden days,
<BR>Happy golden days of yore.
<BR>Faithful friends who are dear to us
<BR>Gather near to us once more.

<P>Through the years we all will be together, if the Fates allow.
<BR>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
<BR>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

<P><U>Garland version</U>:

<P>Have yourself a merry little Christmas
<BR>Let your heart be light.
<BR>Next year all our troubles will be out of sight.

<P>Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
<BR>Make the Yule-tide gay.
<BR>Next year all our troubles will be miles away.

<P>Once again as in olden days,
<BR>Happy golden days of yore.
<BR>Faithful friends who were near to us
<BR>Will be near to us once more.

<P>Someday soon we all will be together, if the Fates allow.
<BR>Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow.
<BR>So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
