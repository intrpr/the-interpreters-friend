<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Behold the glory of God, the Day Star arising. Christ Jesus shines on the earth with mercy enduring! 

<P>1. Night of hope, night of glory divine, darkness conquered evermore. Christ triumphant shines on the earth with joy that endures.

<P>2. Dance for joy all you angels of God. Let the powers of heaven exult. All creation, join now in song: "Salvation is won!"

<P>3. Let the earth in its beauty rejoice, radiant as the morning sky. Chains of death lie shattered this night -- Christ's victory complete!

<P>4. Robed about in the light of the day, let the Church take up its praise. Sacred walls resound with the voice of God's holy ones. 

<P>5. Blessed was the first fall from your grace, blessed was the fateful sin. Blessed more the blood of the Cross (alt. text: victory of Christ): Our God set us free.

<P>6. O how wondrous the gift of your love. Tender gift on our behalf: To redeem a slave lowly born You gave us the Christ.

<P>7. O my God, you are worthy indeed to receive our grateful song. We acclaim the deeds of your hand: "Praise God evermore!"

<P>8. God delivered our life from the snare with a strong and mighty hand; Set us free from all of our foes to worship The Name.

<P>9. Through the fire and water you led with the darkness round about. Death was near; the snare was released; our God set us free!

<P>10. Lift your hands, offering thanks unto God; raise a hymn of endless praise. Blessed be the Lord of our lives, whose mercy endures.

<P>11. With a shout, water fled from the Sea; paths were opened by your Word. Far beyond our thoughts or desires, your mercy is sure!

<P>12. O remember your promise, O God; let your mercy still remain. Save your people who cry out to you, "O God , set us free!"
