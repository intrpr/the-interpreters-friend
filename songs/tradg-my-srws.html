<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I'm trading my sorrows.
<BR>I'm trading my shame.
<BR>I'm laying it all down for the joy of the Lord.

<P>I'm trading my sickness.
<BR>I'm trading my pain.
<BR>I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.

<P>We say yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, yes, Lord.
<BR>Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, yes, Lord.
<BR>Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, yes, Lord. Amen. 

<P>I'm pressed but not crushed, persecuted but not abandoned, 
<BR>Struck down but not destroyed. 
<BR>I am blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure.

<P>That his joy's gonna be my strength,
<BR>Though the sorrow may last for the night, 
<BR>His joy comes with the morning.
