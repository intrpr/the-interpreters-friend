<P>1. I will come to you in the silence,

<BR>You will hear my voice, I claim you as my choice,
<BR>be still and know I am here.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Do not be afraid, I am with you.
<BR>I have called you each by name.

<BR>I love you and you are mine.

<BR>Healing for the ones who dwell in shame.
<BR>All the blind will see, the lame will all run free,
<BR>and all will know my name.

<BR>I am the peace the world cannot give.
<BR>I will call your name, embracing all your pain,
