<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Blessed are the poor in spirit, longing for their Lord,
<BR>for God's coming kingdom shall be theirs.
<BR>Blessed are the sorrowing, for they shall be consoled,
<BR>and the meek shall come to rule the world.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Lead me, Lord, lead me, Lord,
<BR>by the light of truth 
<BR>to seek and to find the narrow way.
<BR>Be my way; be my truth;
<BR>be my life, my Lord,
<BR>and lead me, Lord, today.

<P>2. Blessed are the merciful, for mercy shall be theirs,
<BR>and the pure in heart shall see their God.
<BR>Blest are they whose hunger only holiness can fill,
<BR>for I say they shall be satisfied.

<P>3. Blest are they who through their lifetimes 
<BR>sow the seeds of peace;
<BR>all will call them children of the Lord.
<BR>Blest are you, though persecuted in your holy life,
<BR>for in heaven, great is your reward.
