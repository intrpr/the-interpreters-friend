<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once.

<P>#OWN  - Fingerspelled with a twist.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH - held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Jesus, Jesus, let all creation 
<BR>bend the knee to the Lord.

<P>1. In him we live, we move, and have our being; 
<BR>in him the Christ, in him the king! Jesus, the Lord.

<P>2. Though Son, he did not cling to godliness; 
<BR>but emptied himself, became a slave! Jesus, the Lord.

<P>3. He lived obediently his Father's will 
<BR>accepting his death, death on a tree! Jesus, the Lord.
