<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. God we praise you. God, we bless you.
<BR>God, we name you sovereign Lord.
<BR>Mighty King whom angels worship,
<BR>Father, by your church adored:
<BR>all creation shows your glory,
<BR>heaven and earth draw near your throne
<BR>singing 'Holy, holy, holy,
<BR>Lord of hosts and God alone!

<P>2. 'True apostles, faithful prophets,
<BR>saints who set their world ablaze,
<BR>martyrs, once unknown, unheeded,
<BR>join one growing song of praise,
<BR>while your Church on earth confesses
<BR>one majestic Trinity:
<BR>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
<BR>God, our hope eternally.

<P>3. Jesus Christ, the King of glory,
<BR>everlasting Son of God,
<BR>humble was your virgin mother,
<BR>hard the lonely path you trod:
<BR>by your cross is sin defeated,
<BR>hell confronted face to face,
<BR>heaven opened to believers,
<BR>sinners justified by grace.

<P>4. Christ, at God's right hand victorious,
<BR>you will judge the world you made;
<BR>Lord, in mercy help your servants
<BR>for whose freedom you have paid:
<BR>raise us up from dust to glory,
<BR>guard us from all sin today;
<BR>King enthroned above all praises,
<BR>save your people, God, we pray.
