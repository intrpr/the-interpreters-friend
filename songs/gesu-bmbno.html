<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BLOOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together.

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>SHEPHERD - SHEEP SUPERVISOR.

<P>DOT-SKY - (2h)[5:], POs and FOs diagonally up, hands jab upwards as if dotting the sky with stars.  

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A>  

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.   

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P><U>HIM</U> - Underlined prounouns (<U>ME</>, <U>YOU</>, <U>HE</U>) are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>GREET - Hands alt. salute from forehead, but hands are more diagonal than a military salute.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. When blossoms flowered 'mid the snow upon a winter night, 
<BR>was born the child the Christmas Rose, the King of Love and Light. 
<BR>The angels sang; the shepherds sang. The grateful earth rejoiced. 
<BR>And at His blessed birth the stars their exultation voiced. 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: (3x) O come let us adore Him. :|| Christ the Lord.

<P>2. Again the heart with rapture glows to greet the holy night, 
<BR>that gave the world its Christmas Rose, its King of Love and Light. 
<BR>Let every voice acclaim his name, the grateful chorus swell. 
<BR>From paradise to earth He came that we with Him might dwell.
