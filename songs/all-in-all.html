<P>You are my strength when I am weak.
<BR>You are the treasure that I seek.
<BR>You are my all in all.

<P>Seeking You as a precious jewel,
<BR>Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
<BR>You are my all in all

<P>Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
<BR>Rising up again I bless Your name,
<BR>You are my all in all.

<P>When I fall down You pick me up.
<BR>When I am dry You fill my cup.
<BR>You are my all in all.

<P>||: Jesus, Lamb of God
<BR>Worthy is Your name. :||
