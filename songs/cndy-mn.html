<P>I can't stop eating sweets! All those wonderful Willy Wonka treats. You can keep the others, 'cause me, I'm a Wonkerer. When it comes to candy, Willy's the conqueror. Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew, cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two? The candy man, (The candy man,) the candy man can. (the candy man can.) The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good. Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh, soak in the sun and make a strawb'ry lemon pie? The candy man, (The candy man,) the candy man can. (the candy man can.) The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good. The candy man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious. Talk about your childhood wishes! You can even eat the dishes! Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream? The candy man, (The candy man,) the candy man can. (the candy man can.) The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good. And the world tastes good 'cause the candy man thinks it should.
