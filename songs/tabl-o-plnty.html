<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>FEAST - (2h)alt.EAT. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/f/feast.swf">ASL Pro: Feast.</A>

<P>PLENTY - (2h)[B], NDH PO up, FO away, DH touches thumb side to elbow end of ND arm and then arcs upwards and comes down to touch ND FT, indicating a pile of something.

<P>SAINT - S-NICE.

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A>

<P>BLOSSOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>HARVEST - [S] holds an imaginary handful of grain, and [B], PO up, FO away, slices through the grain below the NDH.

<P>SOIL - (2h)[bO], POs up, FOs away, are held in together in place while thumbs rub against FTs.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Come to the feast of heaven and earth! Come to the table of plenty! God will provide for all that you need, here at the table of plenty.

<P>1. O come and sit at my table where saints and sinners are friends. I wait to welcome the lost and lonely to share the cup of my love. 
          
<P>2. O come and eat without money; come to drink without price. My feast of gladness will feed your spirit with faith and fulness of love. 
          
<P>3. My bread will ever sustain you through days of sorrow and woe. My wine will flow like a sea of gladness to flood the depths of your soul. 
          
<P>4. Your fields will flower in fulness; your homes will flourish in peace. For I, the giver  of home and harvest, will send my rain on the soil.
