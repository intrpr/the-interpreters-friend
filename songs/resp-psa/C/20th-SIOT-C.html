<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>PAH! - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>HELP'stoop down' - Sign HELP, but look down with bent back to role play God.

<P>ATTEND-TO - PAY-ATTENTION.

<P>LIFT-UP - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven. 

<P>POINTY-SURFACE - Use (2h)[B] as CL to show a crag.

<P>PUT-ON-SURFACE - [S], PO > NDS, FO away, places something on [B], PO down, FO > DS. 

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below. 

<P>AWED - (2h)[S], POs >&lt;, FOs up are held at eyes with awed facial expression and the hands open and then close.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>
