<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> CRAZY-FOR - [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side.

<P>SPLENDOR - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.

<P>SKY - using the FT of the upturned palm, point > sky and sweep the hand > DS. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/s/W3674.htm">ASL browser - sky</A>.

<P>CREATE - C-MAKE.

<P>DOT-SKY - (2h)[5:], POs and FOs diagonally up, hands jab upwards as if dotting the sky with stars 

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>NOTHING-TO-IT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, hands move slightly and symetrically from side to side.

<P>LESS-THAN - 2h)[B^], POs ><, FOs up, FTs touch, then moves in an downward arc that approaches the signer. 

<P>ANGEL - (2h)[B^] touch FTs to shoulders, then arms extended and bent move slightly as if flying gently.

<P>CROWN-us - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) place crown on head with large single movement. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/c/crown.swf">ASL Pro: Crown.</A> 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A> 

<P>GIFT-TO-us - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, nod downwards at wrist > signer to show that something is given as a gift.

<P>CREATE - C-MAKE.

<P>UNIVERSE - U-WORLD. 

<P>INFERIOR - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are held side by side, then DH changes PO to down, moves under NDH and returns to its previous handshape. 

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>FLY - (2h)[1] cross fingers as in CONFLICT and move up and away while repeatedly curling fingers like flapping wings. 

<P>fish-SWIM - [B], PO > NDS, FO away, twists while moving away like a fish swimming.

<P>ANYTHING - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone".
