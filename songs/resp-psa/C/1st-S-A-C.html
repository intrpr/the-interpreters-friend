<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>LIFT-UP-TO - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven.

<P>SAVIOR - SAVE AGENT.

<P>RIGHTEOUS - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down.

<P>THEREFORE - [bO] pokes a triangle of dots in the air like the mathematical symbol for "therefore".

<P>SINNER - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest + AGENT. For an animated gif of the fist sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=67">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Sin.</A> 

<P>JUSTICE - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>KINDNESS - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it. 

<P>COVENANT - AGREE RELATIONSHIP-WITH-God.

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>FRIENDS - Interlocked (2h)[X] move in a horizontal circle.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 25:4-5, 8-9, 10, 14)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> To you, O Lord, I lift my soul.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Your ways, O LORD, make known to me;
<BR>teach me your paths,
<BR>Guide me in your truth and teach me,
<BR>for you are God my savior,
<BR>and for you I wait all the day. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Good and upright is the LORD;
<BR>thus he shows sinners the way.
<BR>He guides the humble to justice,
<BR>and teaches the humble his way. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">All the paths of the LORD are kindness and constancy
<BR>toward those who keep his covenant and his decrees.
<BR>The friendship of the LORD is with those who fear him,
<BR>and his covenant, for their instruction. <B>Response</B>
