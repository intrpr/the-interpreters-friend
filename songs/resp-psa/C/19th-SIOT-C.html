<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> 

<P>RIGHTEOUS - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down. 

<P>WORSHIP - NDH is clasped over DH [S] and hands circle perpendicular to the chest.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=55">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Worship.</A> 

<P>PASS-DOWN - (2h)[O^], circle around each other from the shoulder and moving forward, but the action is stop and go.

<P>PRECIOUS - (2h)[5:], hold FTs by the sides of the chin and move down while maintaining contact and closing to (2h)[S]. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once.

<P>KIND - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.
