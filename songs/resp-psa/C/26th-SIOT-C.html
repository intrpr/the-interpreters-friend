<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ALLELUIA! - CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting.

<P><U>HIM</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>OPPRESSED - DH [B], PO down, FO > NDS, pushs down on [S], PO > DS, FO away, which is held against chest.

<P>OPPRESSION-OFF - Starts like PRESSURE, DH [B], PO down, FO away, push down slightly on [S], PO > DS, FO away, then the DH is brought upwards suddenly and the signer mouths "off".

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>RAISE-UP - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, lower slightly, supinate, and rise up. 

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>WICKED - (2h)[3] are held at forehead level and move towards the forehead several times while wg but do not touch the forehead with an evil facial expression. 

<P>OVERTURN - (2h)[5:], POs ><, FOs away, DH is held over NDH, and the hands twist and NDH ends up above DH.

<P>RULE - CONTROL. 

<P>TEMPLE - T-CHURCH. 

<P>PASS-DOWN - (2h)[O^], circle around each other from the shoulder and moving forward, but the action is stop and go.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 146:7, 8-9, 9-10)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Praise the Lord, my soul!

<P><U>or</U>

<P>Alleluia!

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Blessed he who keeps faith forever,
