<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>KNOW-NOTHING - [F], PO > NDS, FOs up, move hand side-to-side slightly at midforehead. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>PRAY - (2h)[B] press palms together and circle vertically normal (perpendicular) to the torso. 

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below.

<P>PAY-OFF - [open 8] runs middle finger up palm (> wrist), changes to a [B], PO down, and then moves back across palm.

<P>SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest.

<P>DEBT - [1^] taps FT against palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/d/debt.swf">ASL Pro: Debt.</A> 

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 19:8, 9, 10, 15)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Your words, Lord, are Spirit and life.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The law of the LORD is perfect,

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The fear of the LORD is pure,
<BR>enduring forever;
<BR>The ordinances of the LORD are true,

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Let the words of my mouth and the thought of my heart
