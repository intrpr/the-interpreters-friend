<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>SUPREME - (2h)[A], FOs away, DH starts below NDH and arcs around it until it is on top.

<P>KIND - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>UPRIGHT - Elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, is struck against the fingers of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE. 

<P>TAKE-OFF - Like DEVELOP but moves quickly and abruptly with a "po". 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>PALM-TREE - NDH [5^] grabs the elbow of [3^] and the DH which is held straight up but bent at wrist, twists at the wrist.

<P>LEBANON - (2h)[index, middle finger and thumb], POs away, FOs up, close repeatedly, like the ASL sign for NO while descending and separating.</B> For a film of this sign, click on <A HREF="http://www.menasy.com/14027.htm">Lebanon - لبنان.</A> (&lt; cedar tree on flag.) 

<P>alt.PUT-IN-PLACE - (2h)[S], POs >&lt;, FOs away, put things in random places.

<P>TEMPLE - T-CHURCH. 

<P>PERKY - Fists are held close to chest and elbows swing out slightly twice. 

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below.

<P>SUDDEN-WRONG 

<P>COLLAPSE - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, interlace fingers and then bring knuckles downwards.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 92:2-3, 13-14, 15-16)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Lord, it is good to give thanks to you.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">It is good to give thanks to the Lord, 
<BR>to sing praise to your name, Most High, 
<BR>to proclaim your kindness at dawn 
<BR>and your faithfulness throughout the night. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The just one shall flourish like the palm tree, 
<BR>like a cedar of Lebanon shall he grow. 
<BR>They that are planted in the house of the Lord
<BR>shall flourish in the courts of our God. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">They shall bear fruit even in old age;
<BR>vigorous and sturdy shall they be, 
<BR>declaring how just is the Lord, 
<BR>my rock, in whom there is no wrong. <B>Response</B>
