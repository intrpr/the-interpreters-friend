<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> MIRACLE - WONDERFUL(1x) WORK. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=43">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Miracle.</A>

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>ANYONE - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone". 

<P>WORSHIP - NDH is clasped over DH [S] and hands circle perpendicular to the chest.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=55">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Worship.</A> 

<P>DRESS-UP - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, alt. circle perpendicular to the chest with thumbs brushing against chest as they pass. 

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A>

<P>ALL - (2h)[B^], POs up, FOs >&lt;, DH circles around NDH and lands on its palm. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/w/whole.swf">ASL Pro: Whole.</A> 

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly. 

<P>TREMBLE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands vibrate from side to side symmetrically to show legs shaking.

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.
