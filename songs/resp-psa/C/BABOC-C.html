<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>JEWISH-PRIEST - (2h)[L], FTs touch the chest just below the neck, separate while still touching and then descend down the sides of the chest. 

<P>PASS-DOWN - (2h)[O^], circle around each other from the shoulder and moving forward, but the action is stop and go.

<P>"<U>THE</U>-rt LORD TELL-lf MY LORD" - Personally I sign LORD, starting like the sign KING, but then arcing upwards so that the index finger ends up pointing to Heaven, and that is how I would do the first LORD in this phrase, and then the second LORD I would sign as L-KING. 

<P>SEATED-ON-my-RIGHT - [V:], PO down, FO away, is held alongside the right side of the signer and descends slightly.

<P>UNTIL - TO.

<P>CRUSH - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, move rapidly away and close the hands to (2h)[A]

<P>SCEPTER - (2h)F-CL describe a vertical "tube" and then S-CL shows it being held.

<P>SYMBOL - S-SHOW+. 

<P>HOLD-UP - Hold the "sceptre" out. 

<P>TEMPLE - T-CHURCH.

<P>SURROUND - [5], PO down, FO away, circles above NDH [1], PO > DS, FO up. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>RULE - CONTROL.

<P>PRINCE - P-KING. 

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A> 

<P>SPLENDOR - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>DEW - WATER + (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away descend with wg like dew.

<P>TAKE-OATH - NDH [B] is raised and DH crosses heart with [open 8].

<P>CHANGE-MIND - Also means MISUNDERSTAND.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 110:1, 2, 3, 4)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The LORD said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
<BR>till I make your enemies your footstool." <B>Response</B>
