<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <P><B>Response:</B> SAVIOR - S-FREE AGENT.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>ANYONE - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone". 

<P>MIRACLE - WONDERFUL(1x) WORK. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=43">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Miracle.</A>

<P>HEAVEN - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs >&lt;, hands are held high, circle around each other and then separate. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>(2h)5-CL'trees sway' - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands sway side to side antisymmetrically.

<P>DEAF-APPLAUSE - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held high and rotate rapidly at wrists.

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly.

<P>RULE - CONTROL.

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.
