<P>GRAIN - [X], PO up, rubs along ND forearm as if harvesting. 

<P>LAYER - [G] runs along palm, FO away, to show layer of a substance. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/L/W2022.htm">ASL browser - layer</A>.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Blessed the man who follows not
<BR>the counsel of the wicked,
<BR>nor walks in the way of sinners,
<BR>nor sits in the company of the insolent,
<BR>but delights in the law of the LORD
<BR>and meditates on his law day and night. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">He is like a tree
planted near running water,
<BR>that yields its fruit in due season,
<BR>and whose leaves never fade.
<BR>Whatever he does, prospers. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Not so the wicked, not so;
<BR>they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
<BR>For the LORD watches over the way of the just,
<BR>but the way of the wicked vanishes. <B>Response</B>
