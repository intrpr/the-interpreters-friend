<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> JOYFUL - alt.HAPPY.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>#ALL-OF-YOU - [A], PO up, FO > DS - held at DS then swings away in an arc and ends [L^], PO up, FO > NDS. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>TAKE-CARE-OF-us - (2h)[K], FOs > signer, cross at wrist and circle perpendicular to chest.  

<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<BR>he made us, his we are;
<BR>his people, the flock he tends.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The LORD is good:
