<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B>JUST / JUSTICE - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle. 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>LIGHT - (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A> 

<P><U>THOSE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>RIGHTEOUS - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly against the backhand of NDH [B], PO down.   

<P>ALLELUIA! - CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting.

<P>SAY-PERIOD - [bO] touches mouth and then pronates (twist PO away) and stop abruptly.

<P>STABLE - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, hands touch and NDH moves away at a constant level.

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern.

<P>alt.GIFT-TO"each"alt.GIFT-TO"each" - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs > the recipents, hands move together from NDS to DS. 

<P>GENEROUS - (2h)[O^] alt. touch heart with FT while PO is > signer, then twist so that PO is up and open to [5].

<P>LIFT-UP - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven. 

<P>SPLENDOR - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 112: 4-5, 6-7, 8-9)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> The just man is a light in darkness to the upright.

<P><U>or</U>:

<P>Alleluia.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Light shines through the darkness for the upright;
<BR>he is gracious and merciful and just.
<BR>Well for the man who is gracious and lends,
<BR>who conducts his affairs with justice. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">He shall never be moved;
<BR>the just one shall be in everlasting remembrance.
<BR>An evil report he shall not fear;
<BR>his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">His heart is steadfast; he shall not fear.
<BR>Lavishly he gives to the poor;
<BR>His justice shall endure forever;
<BR>his horn shall be exalted in glory. <B>Response</B>
