<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>WILL - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>UP-TO-NOW - (2h)[1^], POs down, index fingers travel up the chest on the DS until they end (2h)[1], POs > singer, FOs up.

<P>PAH! - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>TORAH - (2h)[S], POs up, twist twice while separating, as if unrolling a scroll. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/cgi-bin/aslpro/aslpro">ASL Pro.</A> Click "T" under the field labeled "Religious Signs", then scroll down the vocabulary entries to "Torah" and click. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. (same as WILL above.)

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>CONGREGATION - (2h)[5:], POs > signer, FOs up, move forward to show many people 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<BR>a hymn to our God. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Sacrifice or offering you wished not,
<BR>but ears open to obedience you gave me.
<BR>Holocausts or sin-offerings you sought not;
<BR>then said I, "Behold I come." <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,
