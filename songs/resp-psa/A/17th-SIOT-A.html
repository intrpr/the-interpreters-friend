<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>CHERISH - (2h)[5:], hold FTs by the sides of the chin and move down while maintaining contact and closing to (2h)[S].

<P>MORE-THAN - (2h)[B^], touch FTs, then DH moves up in an arc towards the signer and away. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/M/W2393.htm">ASL browser - more than</A>. 

<P>SILVER - [1] touches earlobe and descends in a wavy pattern similar to GOLD. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/s/silver.swf">ASL Pro: Silver.</A> 

<P>COINS - [F], PO > NDS, taps at the upturned palm of [B] in a circle as if there coins in the palm.

<P>HEAPS-OF - (2h)[B], NDH PO up, FO away, DH touches thumb side to elbow end of ND arm and then arcs upwards and comes down to touch ND FT, indicating a pile of something. 

<P>KINDNESS - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it. 

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly. 

<P>COMPASSION - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^] but hands close to heart. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>PURE - Like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity. 

<P>PROGRESS - Like NEXT with hands leapfrogging over one another but upwards.

<P>HATE-IT - The thumb of DH [5], PO > NDS, FO up, touches chin and moves away abruptly.

<P><B>Response:</B> Lord, I love your commands.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">I have said, O LORD, that my part
<BR>is to keep your words.
<BR>The law of your mouth is to me more precious
<BR>than thousands of gold and silver pieces. 
<B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Let your kindness comfort me
<BR>according to your promise to your servants.
<BR>Let your compassion come to me that I may live,
<BR>for your law is my delight.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">For I love your command

<BR>every false way I hate.
