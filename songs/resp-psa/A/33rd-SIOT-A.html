<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> PRAY - (2h)[B] press palms together and circle vertically normal (perpendicular) to the torso. 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> 

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once.

<P>FAVOR - FAVORITE.

<P>GIVE-BIRTH - S-ENTER. Not to be confused with BORN. The child is BORN, the mother GIVE[s]-BIRTH.

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P>VINE - Start like GROW and hands pronate (twist to POs away) and become (2h)[5:]. For a movei fo this sign, go to <A HREF="http://www.dictionaryofsign.com/main.php?g2_itemId=4687&g2_myThumb=">Dictionary of Sign (ASL) - vine.</A>
