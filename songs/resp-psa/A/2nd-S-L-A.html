<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> HAVE-MERCY-ON-us - (2h)[open 8], POs > signer, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/mercy_b.swf">ASL Pro: Mercy - 2.</A> 

<P>UPRIGHT - Elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, is struck against the fingers of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE.

<P>KISS-FIST - Kiss the dorsal side (back) of hand to show you loves something other than a person.

<P>KIND - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.  

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once.

<P>SHIELD - [S] is held as if holding shield and FT of [1] traces a circle where the shield would be.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 33:4-5, 18-19, 20, 22)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Upright is the word of the LORD,
<BR>and all his works are trustworthy.
<BR>He loves justice and right;
<BR>of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,
<BR>upon those who hope for his kindness,
<BR>To deliver them from death
<BR>and preserve them in spite of famine. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Our soul waits for the LORD,
<BR>who is our help and our shield.
<BR>May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us
<BR>who have put our hope in you. <B>Response</B>
