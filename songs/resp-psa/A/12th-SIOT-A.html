<P><B>Response:</B> Lord, in your great love, answer me.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">For your sake I bear insult,
<BR>and shame covers my face.
<BR>I have become an outcast to my brothers,
<BR>a stranger to my children,
<BR>Because zeal for your house consumes me,
<BR>and the insults of those who blaspheme you fall upon me. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">I pray to you, O LORD,
<BR>for the time of your favor, O God!
<BR>In your great kindness answer me
<BR>with your constant help.
<BR>Answer me, O LORD, for bounteous is your kindness;
<BR>in your great mercy turn toward me. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">"See, you lowly ones, and be glad;
<BR>you who seek God, may your hearts revive!
<BR>For the LORD hears the poor,
<BR>and his own who are in bonds he spurns not.
<BR>Let the heavens and the earth praise him,
<BR>the seas and whatever moves in them!" <B>Response</B>
