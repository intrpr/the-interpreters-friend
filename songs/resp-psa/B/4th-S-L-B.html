<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>MUTE - Palmar surface of [A] strikes mouth.

<P>TEMPLE - T-CHRUCH.

<P>leaves-DROOP - (2h)[5], POs > back, FOs down, hands descend and body acts as if a tree with drooping brances.

<P>CAPTURE - ARREST, that is, [5] closes on NDH index finger, PO > DS, FO up.

<P>TAKE-HOLD-OF - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, move down quickly and close to (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, as if grabbing hold of something. 

<P>JUMP-FOR-JOY / JOY - Start with the sign STAND and repeatedly and rapidly raise and lower the DH while curling the FT to show a person jumping.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>JERUSALEM - [B with thumbs flush with other fingers but not folded into palm], touches mouth and then pronates.

<P>CRIPPLED - (2H)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands circle normal (perpendicular] to the body with DH behaing as if it were a crippled leg.

<BR>On the aspens of that land we hung up our harps. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">For there our captors asked of us the lyrics of our songs,
<BR>And our despoilers urged us to be joyous: "Sing for us the songs of Zion!" <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">How could we sing a song of the Lord in a foreign land?

<BR>If I place not Jerusalem ahead of my joy. <B>Response</B>
