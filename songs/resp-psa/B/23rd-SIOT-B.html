<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> OPPRESSION-OFF - Starts like PRESSURE, DH [B], PO down, FO away, push down slightly on [S], PO > DS, FO away, then the DH is brought upwards suddenly and the signer mouths "off".

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>RAISE-UP - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, lower slightly, supinate, and rise up. 

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>GONE - [5^], PO > face, FO up, moves downwards and closes to a [O^], while the NDH is a [B], PO > singer, FO > DS held further away and in neutral space.

<P>WICKED - (2h)[3], wg while moving repeatedly > forehead. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_satan.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Satan.</A>

<P>OVERTURN - (2h)[5:], FOs away, DH is held high, PO down at its side and NDH is held low, PO up at its side. Both hands interchange PO and levels while moving slightly > DS.

<P>PASS-DOWN'bit by bit' - (2h)[O^], circle around each other from the shoulder and moving forward, but the action is stop and go.
