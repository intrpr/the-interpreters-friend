<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>KNOW-NOTHING - [F], PO > NDS, FOs up, move hand side-to-side slightly at midforehead. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P>HONEY - [1] curls under chin to an [X] as if wiping off the chin and then flicks straight down as if the honey were dripping.

<P>BEEHIVE - DH [F] touches the cheek with its joined fingers to represent an insect biting; then changes to a [Bb] and brushes it aside + (2h)[5:] outlines the shape of a beehive. For a QuickTime movie of the first sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/b/W0346.htm">ASL browser - bee</A>.

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 19: 8, 9, 10, 11)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Lord you have the words of everlasting life. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The law of the Lord is perfect,
<BR>refreshing the soul;
<BR>The decree of the Lord is trustworthy,
<BR>giving wisdom to the simple. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The precepts of the Lord are right,
<BR>rejoicing the heart;
<BR>The command of the Lord is clear,
<BR>enlightening the eye. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">The fear of the Lord is pure,
<BR>enduring forever;
<BR>The ordinances of the Lord are true,
<BR>all of them just. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">They are more precious than gold,
<BR>than a heap of purest gold;
<BR>Sweeter also than syrup
<BR>or honey from the comb. <B>Response</B>
