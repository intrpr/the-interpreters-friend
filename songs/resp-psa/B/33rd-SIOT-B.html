<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ANCESTORS - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH is held against forehead, NDH close to head but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards + (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move in a vertical circle while moving back over shoulder.

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>DEFINITELY - (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend rapidly and close to (2h)[F].

<P>OVERTURNED - (2h)[5:], FOs away, DH is held high, PO down at its side and NDH is held low, PO up at its side. Both hands interchange PO and levels while moving slightly > DS. 

<P>THEREFORE - [bO] pokes a triangle of dots in the air like the mathematical symbol for "therefore". 

<P>FAITH - Like THINK TRUST but with elevated hands to show the trust is spiritual. 

<P>DEGENERATE - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs away, both hands descend in an antisymmetric, wavy motion.

<BR>my body, too, abides in confidence;
<BR>because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,
<BR>nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. <B>Response</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">You will show me the path to life,
