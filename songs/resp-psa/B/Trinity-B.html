<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> UPRIGHT - Elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, is struck against the fingers of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE.


<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>KISS-FIST - Kiss the dorsal side (back) of hand to show you loves something other than a person. 

<P>KINDNESS - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it. 

<P>OVERFLOW - [5], PO down, FO away, covers top of [S], PO > DS, FO away, and FT wiggle as the hand moves away, like a cup overflowing. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">ASL browser - overflow</A>. 

<P>APPEAR - SHOW-UP.

<P>BREATH-DOWN - Look down to ctr and hold FTs of (2h)[O^] to nostrils, then move hands away to SPREAD. 

<P>ANGEL - (2h)[B^] touch FTs to shoulders, then arms extended and bent move slightly as if flying gently. 

<P>BREATH-IN - Look up to rt and reverse the process to show breath leaving God's nostrils and entering that of the angels'. 

<P>MAGIC - (2h)[O^], hold out index fingers which describe a circle in the air symmetrically, starting together, rising, separating, etc., and end with the index fingers retracting back to (2h)[O^] and then open to (2h)[5^]. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 


<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>SHIELD - [S] is held as if holding shield and FT of [1] traces a circle where the shield would be. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics (Psalm 33:4-5, 6, 9, 18-19, 20, 22)</U>:</B>

<P><B>Response:</B> Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Upright is the word of the LORD,
<BR>and all his works are trustworthy.
<BR>He loves justice and right;
<BR>of the kindness of the Lord the earth is full.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">By the word of the LORD the heavens were made;
<BR>by the breath of his mouth all their host.
<BR>For he spoke, and it was made;
<BR>he commanded, and it stood forth.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,
<BR>upon those who hope for his kindness,
<BR>To deliver them from death
<BR>and preserve them in spite of famine.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="stained glass bullet">Our soul waits for the LORD,
<BR>who is our help and our shield.
<BR>May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us
<BR>who have put our hope in you.
