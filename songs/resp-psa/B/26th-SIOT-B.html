<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>SOUL - NDH [C] or [S] is held close to body and [F] which inserts FT into NDH then slowly draws it upwards with a wavy path. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=65">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Spirit.</A> 

<P>FRESH - (2h)[5], PO > face, hands move like FRIENDLY but fingers don't wg.

<P>KNOW-NOTHING - [F], PO > NDS, FOs up, move hand side-to-side slightly at midforehead. 

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once.  

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity.

<P>JUST - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>PARDON - Sign EXCUSE, switch dominance and sign EXCUSE again.

<P>OFF-POINT-lf&rt - DH [S], PO > NDS, flicks finger off to the left and then to the right.

<P>SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest.
