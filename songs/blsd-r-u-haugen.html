<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BOW-DOWN-TO - God can bless us, but I take issue with the idea that we can bless God on semantic and theological grounds. The Hebrew <I>baruch</I> (usually translated "bless") is related to the word <I>birkayim</I> (knees), and thus has the meaning of bending the knee to God. This is why I have chosen to translated "blessed" as WE BOW-DOWN-TO.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.   

<P>KIND(NESS) - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it. 

<P>CEREAL - There are many signs for this; one is [X], PO up, rubs along ND forearm as if harvesting. 

<P>SEEDS - [O^], PO down, FO away, moves away while closing to an [A], as if planting seeds. 

<P>LEAD-TO - This is the same as the sign LEAD, but I have added the "-TO" to show how its meaning fits into the sentence. 

<P>GROW-TALL - GROW with the DH ending higher in the air than usual and mroe emphatic.

<P>(2h)C-CL'loaf' - (2h)[C], POs away, FOs up, are held next to one another and separate to show the shpae of a loaf of bread.

<P>GROUP-TOGETHER - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are brought together as if pushing people/things together into a group. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if  holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>THEREABOUTS - [5], PO down, FO away, circles parllel to the floor.

<P>JOIN-us - looks like JOIN but the DH - inserted from the other side of the NDH. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>Special note: There is an optional chant for choir underneath the soloist repeating, "<I>Baruch atah adonai, Elohenu.</I>" (Hebrew - Blessed are you, our God.) Verse 3 leads to an interlude where the choir will chant, "<I>Baruch atah, baruch atah, bar-</I> (Blessed are you, blessed are you, ble-)" and then verse 4 begins. At the end of verse 5, the soloist sings for a third time, "Blessed be you with every breath."

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1, 5. Blessed are you who made the universe, you who see beyond our death. Blessed are you who dwells in each of us. Blessed be you with every breath.

<P>2. Through your goodness we have bread to eat, seeds that died to bring life new, as the separate grains become one loaf, gather us as one in you. 

<P>3. Through your goodness we have wine to drink, fruit of vineyard, work of hands. Let the fruits of all we celebrate spread your love to every land.  

<P>4. Here the stranger is a welcome guest. Here all hungers shall be fed. Come and know the one who brings you life in breaking of the bread.
