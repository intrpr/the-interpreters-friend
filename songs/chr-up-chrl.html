<P>BLOW-ON-HAND - Bring head forward, close to palm and blow on it.

<P>(2h)5wg-CL'float away' - Downturned hands move upwards.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>CHARLEY'C taps chin' - I use this name sign because the musical is all about eating, but obviously you can make up your own name sign.

<P>Q-M - Trace a question mark with your index finger. Index curls and uncurls during the trace.

<P>GRIN  - Trace a grin on your face with the index finger side of [Bb], PO down, FO > NDS. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>TOY - T-PLAY. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/T/W4206.htm">ASL browser - toy</A>.

<P>THUMBS-DOWN++, THUMBS-UP++ - (1h)[A dot] or (2h) are held with thumbs down and descend in steps, or thumbs up and ascend in steps.

<P>SUPREME - (2h)[A], FOs away, DH starts below NDH and arcs around it until it is on top.

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>HON.-IX - Use the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>PRETTY [SOON] - The sign for PRETTY is used here, even though it is not used in its literal sense.

<P>SKY - using the FT of the upturned palm, point > sky and sweep the hand > DS. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/s/W3674.htm">ASL browser - sky</A>. 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U>'sweep down slowly' - Using the FT of the upturned palm, point > Charlie and sweep the hands downwards.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> You get blue like everyone; but me and Grandpa Joe can make your troubles go away, blow-away. There they go. Cheer up, Charlie, give me a smile. What happened to the smile I used to know? Don't you know your grin has always been my sunshine? Let the sunshine show! Come on, Charlie, no need to frown. Deep down you know tomorrow is your toy. When the days get heavy, never pit-a-pat 'em. Up and at 'em, boy! Some day, sweet as a song, Charlie's lucky day will come along. 'Til that day you've gotta stay in strong, Charlie. Up on top is right where you belong. Look up, Charlie, you'll see a star. Just follow it and keep your dreams in view. Pretty soon the skies are gonna clear up, Charlie. Cheer up, Charlie, do. Cheer up, Charlie, just be glad you're you.
