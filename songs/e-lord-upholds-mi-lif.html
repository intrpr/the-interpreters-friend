<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>ATTEND-TO - PAY-ATTENTION.

<P>PRAYER - (2h)[B] press palms together and circle vertically normal (perpendicular) to the torso.

<P>ARROGANT - (2h)[L:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, are held at forehead and suddenly expand. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/B/W0468.htm">ASL browser - brat</A>. 

<P>CRUEL - MEAN. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>LIFT-UP~OFFER - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven and move towards it.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Ostinato refrain:</B> The Lord upholds my life. (Repeated as different voices sing over it.)

<P>1. God, save me by your name,
<BR>and by your might defend my life. 
<BR>O God, hear my prayer, 
<BR>listen to my words.

<P>2. The proud, the proud have risen against me, 
<BR>and the fierce they seek my life.
<BR>They set not the Lord before their eyes. 
<BR>They seek not the Lord.

<P>3. Behold! (Behold!) God is my help. 
<BR>The Lord sustains me. 
<BR>Freely, (Freely,) I will offer you my life. 
<BR>I will praise your name. I will praise your name. I will praise.
