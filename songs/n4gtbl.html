<P>ME CAN'T FORGET <U>YOU</U>. SWEET LONG-LIST.
<BR>ME CAN'T FORGET <U>YOU</U>. 
<BR>(&lt;) TOGETHER, (>) TWO-APART, DOESN'T-MATTER, STILL.
<BR>IDEA-LIKE SONG ABOUT LOVE FOREVER,
<BR>ME STOP VISUALIZE <U>YOU</U>, NEVER.
<BR>KNOW-THAT UP-TO-NOW NONE MEAN MORE. INSPIRED.

<P>||: ME CAN'T FORGET <U>YOU</U>. SWEET LONG-LIST.
<BR>FROM-NOW-ON FOREVER, TWO-OF-US STAY me-CONNECTED-TO-you.
<BR>THAT MY REASON, HARD BELIEVE
<BR>SOMEONE LIKE <U>YOU</U>, ME CAN'T FORGET,
<BR>FEEL <U>YOU</U> CAN'T FORGET <U>ME</U> you-SAME-AS-me. :|| 
 
<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.        

<P>LONG-LIST - (2h)[O^], POs > signer, NDH - above and touches DH; both hands open to (2h)[5] while DH descends. 

<P>TWO-APART - (2h)[1], FOs up, touch at palms and then separate in an upward arc.

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>(2h)#NO - Both hands sign NO but forcefully and close only once.

<P>you-SAME-AS-me - (2h)[Y], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move to and fro.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Unforgettable, that's what you are. 
<BR>Unforgettable though near or far.
<BR>Like a song of love that clings to me, 
<BR>How the thought of you does things to me. 
<BR>Never before has someone been more. 

<P>Unforgettable in every way, 
<BR>And forever more, that's how you'll stay. 
<BR>That's why, darling, it's incredible, 
<BR>That someone so unforgettable. 
<BR>Thinks that I am unforgettable, too.
