<P>I sing the body electric
<BR>I celebrate the me yet to come
<BR>I toast to my own reunion
<BR>When I become one with the sun

<P>And I'll look back on Venus, I'll look back on Mars
<BR>And I'll burn with the fire of ten million stars
<BR>And in time, and in time, we will all be stars

<P>I sing the body electric
<BR>I glory in the glow of rebirth
<BR>Creating my own tomorrow
<BR>When I shall embody the earth

<P>And I'll serenade Venus, I'll serenade Mars
<BR>And I'll burn with the fire of ten million stars
<BR>And in time, and in time, we will all be stars

<P>We are the emperors now, and we are the czars
<BR>And in time, and in time, we will all be stars

<P>I sing the body Electric
<BR>I celebrate the me yet to come
<BR>I toast to my own reunion my own reunion
<BR>When I become one with the sun

<P>And I'll look back on Venus, I'll look back on Mars
<BR>I'll burn with the fire of ten million stars
<BR>And in time, and in time, and in time, and in time
<BR>And in time, and in time, we will all be stars
