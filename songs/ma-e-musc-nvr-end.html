<P>May the music never end
<BR>Surround us with a circle of love
<BR>Let our hearts keep singing
<BR>and this song keep ringing through our lives
<BR>As we leave this place my friend
<BR>And may the music never end

<P>Familiar hearts
<BR>Fill this room with love
<BR>Its been so many years
<BR>Of laughter and of tears
<BR>And I cherish every moment that we share
<BR>Memories I'll be thinking of
<BR>Are reflections of your love

<P>May the music never end
<BR>Surround us with a circle of love
<BR>May our hearts keep singing
<BR>And this song keep ringing through our lives
<BR>As we leave this place my friend
<BR>My friend
<BR>And may the music never end....

<P>And may the music never end....
