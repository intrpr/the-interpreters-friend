<BR>we'll pass the Word along;
<BR>with one voice,

<BR>we'll spread the goodness of God.
<BR>With all power and glory 
<BR>the Word of God shall reign.

<P>2. Take the Word 
<BR>to our neighborhoods and streets:

<BR>in peace and harmony. 
<BR>They will see and sing:

<P>3. Take the Word 
<BR>to the people in despair:
