<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>WILDERNESS - COUNTRY SETTLE, NOT-YET. Where the second sign is (2h)[5], POs down, FOs away, descend with several stops along the way.

<P>Notice that some verses have a refrain, and some don't. 

<P>ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>BECOME-LOW - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer.

<P>BLOSSOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together. 

<P>SHINY - (2h)[open 8], POs down, FOs away, twist rapidly at wrists while rising. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/s/shine.swf">ASL Pro: Shine.</A>
