<P>Come, come, ye Sons of Art
<BR>Come, come away,
<BR>Tune all your voices and instruments play
<BR>To celebrate this triumphant day.

<P>The day that such a blessing gave
<BR>No common festival should be.
<BR>What it justly seems to crave,
<BR>Grant, oh grant, and let it have
<BR>The honour of a jubilee. 

<P>||: Thus Nature, rejoicing, has shown us the way,
<BR>With innocent revels to welcome the day.
<BR>The tuneful grove and talking rill
<BR>The laughing vale, replying hill
<BR>With charming harmony unite
<BR>This happy season to invite. :||

<P>What the Graces require and the Muses inspire
<BR>Is at once our delight and our duty to pay.
<BR>Thus Nature...
