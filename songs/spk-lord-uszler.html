<P><B>Refrain:</B> Speak, Lord, I love to listen to your voice. See, Lord, here I am.

<P>2. Your word is life, O Lord, through all my days, like a radiant light guiding my way. Your law stands firm, O Lord, strong as a rock. It endures through the night and the storm.

<P>3. Your word is like a lamp burning so bright, showing the path ahead, giving me sight. In darkness I am lost: your word give light. Speak to me, live in me, saving Word.

<P>4. I am the Teacher Christ, speaking to you. Here is my mighty word, holy and true. Come, listen when I speak words filled with light. Learn of me, of my live, of my love.
