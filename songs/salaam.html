<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>SOME-DAY - WILL/FUTURE but hand twists slightly at wrist as it moves forward.

<P>OD BO SHALOM ALEINU - This line has the same meaning as the first line (in the original Hebrew). Because this song is so immensely repetitive, it would be nice to mix some Israeli Sign Language in. This phrase is signed as follows:<DIR>
OD - SECOND, as in "first, second, third".
<P>BO - (1h)COME.
<P>SHALOM - (2h)[C] tightly interlink FTs.
<P>ALEINU (AL ANACHNU) - ON + [1^], PO down, circles horizontally. 
</DIR>

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>SALAAM - This is the Arabic word for peace and is in the original Hebrew lyrics to make the point that Palestinians must be included in this process, so I sought out a sign for "salaam". Ideally the Palestinian sign would be used, but the best I could come up with was the Saudi Arabian sign for "asalaam aleikum (Peace be unto you!)" The NDH holds the [B] against the temple on the NDS as if a salute were starting, but does not move. The DH is an [S] and it looks like it is shaking hands.
