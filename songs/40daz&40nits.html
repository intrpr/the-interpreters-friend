<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Forty days and forty nights
<BR>Thou wast fasting in the wild;
<BR>Forty days and forty nights
<BR>Tempted, and yet undefiled.

<P>2. [Some versions skip this verse] 
<BR>Sunbeams scorching all the day;
<BR>Chilly dew-drops nightly shed;
<BR>Prowling beasts about Thy way;
<BR>Stones Thy pillow; earth Thy bed.

<P>3. Should not we Thy sorrow share
<BR>And from worldly joys abstain,
<BR>Fasting with unceasing prayer,
<BR>Strong with Thee to suffer pain?

<P>4. Then if Satan on us press,
<BR>Jesus, Savior, hear our call!
<BR>Victor in the wilderness,
<BR>Grant we may not faint nor fall!

<P>5. So shall we have peace divine:
<BR>Holier gladness ours shall be;
<BR>Round us, too, shall angels shine,
<BR>Such as ministered to Thee.

<P>6. Keep, O keep us, Savior dear,
<BR>Ever constant by Thy side;
<BR>That with Thee we may appear
<BR>At the eternal Eastertide.
