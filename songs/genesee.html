<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Full many fair and famous streams beneath the sun there be. Yet more than any seems our own dear Genesee. We love thy banks and stately falls, for to our minds they bring (caesura) our dear old Alma Mater's halls, where sweetest memories cling.

<P>2. No castled crags along her way Roman splendors cast, no fabled or historic lay recalls the golden past, but more than battlemented walls or legend they may bear (caesura) are dear old Alma Mater's halls and memories lingering there.

<P>3. As flows the river, gathering force, along her steadfast way, may we along life's devious course grow stronger day by day, and may our hearts wheree'er we roam forever loyal  be (caesura) to our beloved college home beside the Genesee.
