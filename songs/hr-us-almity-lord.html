<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Hear us, almighty Lord. Show us your mercy. Sinners we stand here before you.

<P>1. Jesus our Savior, Lord of all the nations, 
<BR>Christ our Redeemer, hear the prayers we offer. 
<BR>Spare us and save us. Comfort us in sorrow.

<P>2. Word of the Father, keystone of God's building, 
<BR>source of our gladness, gateway to the Kingdom, 
<BR>Free us in mercy from the sins that bind us.

<P>3. God of compassion, Lord of might and splendor, 
<BR>graciously listen. Hear our cries of anguish. 
<BR>Touch us and heal us where our sins have wounded.

<P>4. Humbly confessing that we have offended, 
<BR>stripped of illusions, naked in our sorrow, 
<BR>pardon, Lord Jesus, those your blood has ransomed.

<P>5. Innocent captive, you were led to slaughter.
<BR>Sentenced by sinners when they brought false witness.
<BR>Keep from damnation those your death has rescued.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Attende Domine, et miserere, quia peccavimus tibi.

<P>1. Ad te Rex summe, omnium Redemptor,
<BR>oculos nostros sublevamus flentes:
<BR>exaudi, Christe, supplicantum preces. 

<P>2. Dextera Patris, lapis angularis,
<BR>via salutis, ianua caelestis,
<BR>ablue nostri maculas delicti.

<P>3. Rogamus, Deus, tuam maiestatem:
<BR>auribus sacris gemitus exaudi:
<BR>crimina nostra placidus indulge.

<P>4. Tibi fatemur crimina admissa:
<BR>contrito corde pandimus occulta:
<BR>tua, Redemptor, pietas ignoscat.

<P>5. Innocens captus, nec repugnans ductus;
<BR>testibus falsis pro impiis damnatus
<BR>quos redemisti, tu conserva, Christe.
