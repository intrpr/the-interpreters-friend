<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Healing river of the Spirit,
<BR>bathe the wounds that living brings.
<BR>Plunge our pain, our sin, our sadness
<BR>deep beneath your sacred springs.
<BR>Weary from the restless searching
<BR>that has lured us from your side,
<BR>we discover in your presence
<BR>peace the world cannot provide.

<P>2. Wellspring of the healing Spirit,
<BR>stream that flows to bring release,
<BR>as we gain our selves, our senses,
<BR>may our lives reflect your peace.
<BR>Grateful for the flood that heals us,
<BR>may your church enact your grace.
<BR>As we meet both friend and stranger,
<BR>may we see our Savior's face.

<P>3. Living stream that heals the nations,
<BR>make us channels of your pow'r.
<BR>All the world is torn by conflict;
<BR>wars are raging at this hour.
<BR>Saving Spirit, move among us,
<BR>guide our winding human course.
<BR>till we find our way together,
<BR>flowing homeward to our Source.
