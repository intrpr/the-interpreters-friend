<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>GATHER-IN - (2h)[B], POs UP, FOs away, hands keep PO the same but flip up the fingers so that they become (2h)[B^] several times and move in a horizontal circle.

<P>BASIN - BOWL but large enough for washing feet. 

<P>PROPORTIONAL - (2h)[P], POs down, FOs away, move downwards at NDS then at DS. This sign is used here to show a metaphor/simile.
 
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Jesus, our teacher and our Lord, 
<BR>stooped to wash the feet of his disciples, 
<BR>and he told them, "This is an example; 
<BR>as I have done, so you must do."

<P>1. When Jesus had gathered with those he loved, 
<BR>as a humble servant he knelt at their feet. 

<P>2. With towel and basin he washed their feet, 
<BR>so that they might share in his passion and death.

<P>3. He asked, "Do you know what I have done?
<BR>I give you a witness of what you must do."

<P>4. "As I, your teacher, have washed your feet,
<BR>so you be willing to serve in my name."

<P>5. "A new commandment I give to you,
<BR>that you love each other as I have loved you."
