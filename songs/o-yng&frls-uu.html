<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O young and fearless Prophet of ancient Galilee,
<BR>Thy life is still a summons to serve humanity;
<BR>To make our thoughts and actions less prone to please the crowd,
<BR>To stand with humble courage for truth with hearts uncowed.

<P>2. O help us stand unswerving against war’s bloody way,
<BR>Where hate and lust and falsehood hold back the holy sway;
<BR>Forbid false love of country that blinds us to His call,
<BR>Who lifts above the nations the unity of all.

<P>3. Create in us the splendor that dawns when hearts are kind,
<BR>That knows not race nor station as boundaries of the mind;
<BR>That learns to value beauty, in heart, or brain, or soul,
<BR>And longs to see God’s children as one perfect whole.

<P>4. Stir up in us a protest against our greed for wealth,
<BR>While others starve and hunger and plead for work and health;
<BR>Once more to hear Thy challenge above our noisy day,
<BR>Again to lead us forward along the holy way.
