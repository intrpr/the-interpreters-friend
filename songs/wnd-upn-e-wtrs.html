<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Wind upon the waters, 
<BR>voice upon the deep,
<BR>rouse your sons and daughters. 
<BR>Wake us from our sleep,
<BR>breathing life into all flesh, 
<BR>breathing love into all hearts,
<BR>living wind upon the waters of my soul.

<P>2. Showers from the heavens,
<BR>water from the earth;
<BR>gift so wholly given,
<BR>source of every birth.
<BR>Joy of every living thing,
<BR>making all creation sing,
<BR>shower down upon the waters of my soul.

<P>3. Rock and hill and garden,
<BR>wood and desert sand,
<BR>prairie, field and meadow,
<BR>shaped by Love's own hand,
<BR>Love that fills the world around, 
<BR>springing up from barren ground,
<BR>grow your love within the garden of my soul.

<P>4. Blazing light of wonder,
<BR>flame that pierces night,
<BR>burst the dark asunder.
<BR>Fill our souls with light.
<BR>Lord of glory, fill the skies.
<BR>Make an end to hatred's cries.
<BR>Be the blazing Sun of justice in our lives.

<P>5. Wind upon the waters,
<BR>rains upon the sand,
<BR>grace your sons and daughters,
<BR>newborn by your hand.
<BR>Come O Spirit, and renew 
<BR>all the life that comes from you. 
<BR>Send your winds upon the waters of my soul.
