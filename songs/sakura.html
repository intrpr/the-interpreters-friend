<P>1. Cherry Blossoms, cherry blossoms.  
<BR>On mountains, in villages.  
<BR>As far as you can see.  
<BR>Like a mist or floating cloud.  
<BR>They are fragrant in the morning sun.  
<BR>Cherry Blossoms, cherry blossoms.  
<BR>In full bloom.    

<P>2. Cherry Blossoms, cherry blossoms.  
<BR>Bloom so bright in April breeze.  
<BR>Like a mist or floating cloud.  
<BR>Fragrance fills the air around.  
<BR>Shadows flit along the ground.  
<BR>Come, oh, come. Come, oh, come.  
<BR>Come see cherry trees.

<P>Sakura, Sakura, 
<BR>Noyamamo satomo
