<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>There is a candle in every soul.
<BR>Some brightly burning, some dark and cold.
<BR>There is a Spirit who brings a fire,
<BR>Ignites a candle and makes His home.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Carry your candle; run to the darkness.
<BR>Seek out the helpless, confused and torn,
<BR>And hold out your candle for all to see it.
<BR>||: Take your candle, and go light your world. :||

<P>Frustrated brother, see how he's tried to
<BR>Light his own candle some other way.
<BR>See now your sister; she's been robbed and lied to,
<BR>Still holds a candle without a flame.

<P>So... <B>Refrain</B>

<P>We are a family whose hearts are blazing,
<BR>So let's raise our candles and light up the sky,
<BR>Praying to our Father, in the name of Jesus,
<BR>Make us a beacon in darkest times. <B>Refrain</B> (2x)
