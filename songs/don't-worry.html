<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Here's a little song I wrote.
<BR>You might want to sing it note for note.
<BR>Don't worry, be happy.
<BR>In every life we have some trouble,
<BR>But when you worry you make it double.
<BR>Don't worry, be happy.

<P>Ain't got no place to lay your head.
<BR>Somebody came and took your bed.
<BR>Don't worry, be happy.
<BR>The landlord say your rent is late.
<BR>He may have to litigate.
<BR>Don't worry, be happy.
