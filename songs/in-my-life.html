<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. There are places i remember all my life,
<BR>Though some have changed,
<BR>Some forever, not for better,
<BR>Some have gone and some remain.

<P>2. All these places had their moments
<BR>With lovers and friends i still can recall.
<BR>Some are dead and some are living.
<BR>In my life i've loved them all.

<P>3. But of all these friends and lovers,
<BR>There is no one compares with you,
<BR>And these memories lost their meaning
<BR>When i think of love as something new.

<P>4. Though i know i'll never lose affection
<BR>For people and things that went before,
<BR>I know i'll often stop and think about them,
<BR>In my life i'll love you more.

<P>5. Though i know i'll never lose affection
<BR>For people and things that went before,
<BR>I know i'll often stop and think about them,
<BR>In my life i'll love you more.
<BR>In my life i'll love you more.
