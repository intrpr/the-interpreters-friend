<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
<BR>Every day that I live
<BR>With every breath I breathe.
<BR>Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
<BR>Everywhere that I go.
<BR>Lord, let Your presence flow.
<BR>Rain on me.

<P>Love divine,  joy unspeakable,
<BR>Overflowing in my soul.
<BR>This heart of mine is refreshed and at rest
<BR>In Your presence, in Your presence,
<BR>In Your presence, in Your presence.
