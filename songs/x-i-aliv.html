<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
<BR>The cross stands empty to the sky.
<BR>Let streets and homes with praises ring.
<BR>Love, drowned in death, shall never die.

<P>2. Christ is alive! No longer bound
<BR>to distant years in Palestine,
<BR>but saving, healing, here and now,
<BR>and touching every place and time.

<P>3. Not throned above, remotely high,
<BR>untouched, unmoved by human pains,
<BR>but daily, in the midst of life,
<BR>our Savior with the Father reigns.

<P>4. In every insult, rift, and war
<BR>where color, scorn or wealth divide,
<BR>Christ suffers still, yet loves the more,
<BR>and lives, where even hope has died.

<P>5. Women and men, in age and youth,
<BR>can feel the Spirit, hear the call,
<BR>and find the way, the life, the truth,
<BR>revealed in Jesus, freed for all.

<P>6. Christ is alive, and comes to bring
<BR>good news to this and every age,
<BR>till earth and sky and ocean ring
<BR>with joy, with justice, love, and praise.
