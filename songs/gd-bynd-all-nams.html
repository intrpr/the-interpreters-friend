<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. God, beyond our dreams, you have stirred in us a memory,
<BR>you have placed your powerful spirit in the hearts of humankind.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> All around us, we have known you; 
<BR>all creation lives to hold you,
<BR>In our living and our dying 
<BR>we are bringing you to birth. 

<P>2. God, beyond all names, you have made us in your image,
<BR>we are like you, we reflect you, we are woman, we are man.

<P>3. God, beyond all words, all creation tells your story,
<BR>you have shaken with our laughter, you have trembled with our tears.

<P>4. God, beyond all time, you are laboring within us;
<BR>we are moving, we are changing, in your spirit ever new.

<P>5. God of tender care, you have cradled us in goodness,
<BR>you have mothered us in wholeness, you have loved us into birth.
