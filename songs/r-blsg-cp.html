<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Our blessing cup is a communion with the blood of Christ; [Optional descant: Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi.] and the bread we break, it is a sharing in the body of the Lord.

<P>1. How can we make a return for all the goodness God has shown? We will take the cup of life, and call upon God's name.

<P>2. Precious indeed in your sight, the life and death of those you love. We are your servants, for you have set us free.

<P>3. Gracious and merciful God, we give you thanks and bless your name: with all your people, praise and glory to your name.

<P>4. For you have heard my voice, for you have heard my pleading. Though death surrounded me, you heard and answered me.
