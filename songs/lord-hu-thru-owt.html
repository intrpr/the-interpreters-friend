<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lord, who throughout these forty days, 
<BR>for us did fast and pray,
<BR>teach us to overcome our sins, 
<BR>and close by you to stay.

<P>2. As you with Satan did contend,
<BR>and did the victory win,
<BR>O give us strength in you to fight,
<BR>in you to conquer sin.

<P>3. As you did hunger and did thirst,
<BR>so teach us, Lord, gracious Lord,
<BR>to die to self, and so to live
<BR>by your most holy word.

<P>4. And through these days of penitence,
<BR>and through your Passiontide,
<BR>forevermore, in life and death,
<BR>O Lord! with us abide.

<P>5. Abide with us, that through this life
<BR>of doubts and hope and pain,
<BR>an Easter of unending joy
<BR>we may at last attain!
