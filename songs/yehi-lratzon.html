<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>REALLY-WANT PRAYER <U>ME</U> EXPRESS, alt.IDEA INSIDE-SELF HEART, <U>YOU</U> ACCEPT LORD.  <U>YOU</U> MY FOUNDATION. MY DEBT, <U>YOU</U> PAY-OFF.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined prounouns (<U>ME</>, <U>YOU</>, <U>HE</U>) are honorific index (HON.-IX), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>FOUNDATION - NDH [S], PO > signer, FO > DS, - held out with arm parallel to the chest and DH [S], PO > signer, strikes hand from below and then strikes elbow from below.

<P>PAY-OFF - Middle finger of [open 8] slides down NDH [B] from FT to wrist plys CLEAN.        

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Lord, may the words in my mouth, and may the meditation in my heart, be accepted in Thy sight. You are my strength and my redeemer.
