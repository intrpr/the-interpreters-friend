<P>Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - Hold the FT of [C] against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>NO-MORE - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>BLOOM"each" - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together. This sign is repeated several times while moving from NDS to DS.

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Joy to the world! The Lord is come: 
<BR>Let earth receive her King;
<BR>Let every heart prepare him room, 
<BR>And heaven and nature sing. 

<P>2. Joy to the world! The Savior reigns: 
<BR>Let us our songs employ; 
<BR>While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
<BR>Repeat the sounding joy. 

<P>3. No more let sins and sorrows grow,
<BR>Nor thorns infest the ground;
<BR>He comes to make His blessings flow
<BR>Far as the curse is found. 

<P>4. He rules the world with truth and grace,
<BR>And makes the nations prove
<BR>The glories of his righteousness,
<BR>And wonders of His love.
