<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O breathe on me, O Breath of God, fill me with life anew, that I may love the things you love, and do what you would do.

<P>2. O breath on me, O Breath of God, until my heart is pure; until my will is one with yours, to do and to endure.

<P>3. O breath on me, O Breath of God, my will to yours incline, until this selfish part of me glows with your fire divine.

<P>4. O breath on me, O Breath of God, so I shall never die, but live with you the perfect life for all eternity.
