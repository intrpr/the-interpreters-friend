<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Change our hearts this time, your word says it can be. Change our minds this time, your life could make us free. We are the people your call sets apart. Lord, this time change our hearts.

<P>1. Brought by your hand to the edge of our dreams, one foot in paradise, one in the waste. Drawn by your promises, still we are lured by the shadows and the chains we leave behind. But ... 

<P>2. Now as we watch you stretch out your hands, offering abundances, fullness of joy, your milk and honey seem distant, unreal, when we have bread and water in our hands. But ... 

<P>3. Show us the way that leads to your side, over the mountains and sands of the soul. Be for us manna, water from stone, light which says we never walk alone. And ...
