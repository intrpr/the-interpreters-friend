<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lord, You give the great commission: 
<BR>"Heal the sick and preach the Word."
<BR>Lest the Church neglect its mission, 
<BR>and the Gospel go unheard,
<BR>Help us witness to Your purpose 
<BR>with renewed integrity,
<BR>With the Spirit's gifts empower us 
<BR>for the work of ministry.

<P>2. Lord, You call us to Your service: 
<BR>"In My Name baptize and teach."
<BR>That the world may trust Your promise, 
<BR>life abundant meant for each,
<BR>Give us all new fervor, 
<BR>draw us closer in community.
<BR>With the Spirit's gifts empower 
<BR>us for the work of ministry.

<P>3. Lord, You make the common holy: 
<BR>"This My body, this My blood."
<BR>Let us all, for earth's true glory, 
<BR>daily lift life heavenward,
<BR>Asking that the world around us 
<BR>share your children's liberty
<BR>With the Spirit's gifts empower us 
<BR>for the work of ministry.

<P>4. Lord, You show us love's true measure: 
<BR>"Father, what they do, forgive."
<BR>Yet we hoard as private treasure 
<BR>all that You so freely give.
<BR>May Your care and mercy lead us 
<BR>to a just society.
<BR>With the Spirit's gifts empower us 
<BR>for the work of ministry.

<P>5. Lord, you bless with words assuring: 
<BR>"I am with you to the end."
<BR>Faith and hope and love restoring, 
<BR>may we serve as you intend
<BR>And, amid the cares that claim us, 
<BR>hold in mind eternity.
<BR>With the Spirit's gifts empower us 
<BR>for the work of ministry.
