<P>SCADS-OF is (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, move forward to show many beings. 

<P>The italicized "FOREVER" is executed with the NDH while the DH stays in place.  

<P>MARTYR - [M] drawn across the throat as if it is being slit. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/martyr.swf">ASL Pro: Martyr.</A> 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!  Let angels prostrate fall.
<BR>Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him   Lord of all,

<P>2. Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,  ye ransomed from the fall,
<BR>Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all 

<P>3. Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
      The wormwood and the gall
<BR>      Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
      And crown Him Lord of all.

<P>4. Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball
<BR>To Him all majesty ascribe, and crown Him Lord of all 

<P>5. Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God
      Who from His altar call:
<BR>      Extol Him in whose path ye trod,
      And crown Him Lord of all.

<P>6. O that with yonder sacred throng, we at His feet may fall!
<BR>We'll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all
