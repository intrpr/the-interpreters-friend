<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Praise the God who changes places, leaves the lofty seat, 
welcomes us with warm embraces, stoops to wash our feet.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Stand up friends! Hold your heads up high. Freedom is our song! Alleluia!

<P>2. Priase the Rabbi, speaking, doing, all that God intends, 
dying, rising, faith renewing, calling us his friends.

<P>3. Praise the Breath of Love, whose freedom spreads our waking wings,
lifting every blight and burden till the Spirit sings:

<P>4. Praise, until we join the singing far beyond our sight, 
with the Ending and Beginning daring in the light.
