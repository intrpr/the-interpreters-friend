<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> WORSHIP - NDH is clasped over DH [S] and hands circle perpendicular to the chest.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=55">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Worship.</A> 

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>LIFT-UP - (2h)[B], PO down are held high and swoop down while supinating and then rise up again as if helping something mature and the hands continue up and FTs are directed > Heaven. 

<P>HIGH* - [H], PO > NDS, FO away, rises suddenly and high.

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly. 

<P>SKY - using the FT of the upturned palm, point > sky and sweep the hand > DS. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/s/W3674.htm">ASL browser - sky</A>.

<P>ASK-QUESTION-us - [S], PO > signer, FO up, flicks finger in face as if we are being asked a question.  

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>We will worship the Lamb of glory.
<BR>We will worship the King of kings.
<BR>We will worship the Lamb of glory.
<BR>We will worship the King. 

<P>I bless the name of the Lamb of glory.
<BR>I bless the name of the King of kings.
<BR>I bless the name of the Lamb of glory.
<BR>I bless the name of the King. 
   
<P>And with our hands lifted high.
<BR>We will worship and sing.
<BR>And with our hands lifted high,
<BR>We come before You rejoicing.

<P>With our hands lifted high to the sky,
<BR>When the world wonders why,
<BR>We'll just tell them we're loving our King.
<BR>We'll just tell them we're loving our King.
