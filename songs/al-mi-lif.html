<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>JOURNEY - [V:], PO down, FO away, moves away in a curvy pattern.

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>ALL-ALONG - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, fingers run up the chest somewhat slowly on DS until POs are > signer, and FOs are up. To show this means "all my life", that is to say a long time, execute this sign rather slowly.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>FROM-NOW-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DHFT touches knuckle side of NDHFT and moves away in a downward arc. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1382.htm">ASL browser - from now on</A>.

<P>TAKE-IN - (2h)[3], POs >&lt;, FOs away, thumbs point at eye level and move several times > signer while FT wg, not thumbs. The positioning of the hands show that it could be to take it in visually or aurally. 

<P>THUNDER - Touch ear with index finger then (2h)[S], PO down, FO away, move antisymmetrically from side to side while mouthing "pow". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/t/W4151.htm">ASL browser - thunder</A>.

<P>TREMBLE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands vibrate from side to side symmetrically to show legs shaking. 

<P>CRAZY-FOR - [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side.

<P>STUMBLE~FALL - STUMBLE - DH [P], PO down, FO away, moved forward until the middle finger trips over the NDH [1], PO > signer, FO > DS and then DH changes to a [V:] and spirals away from the NDH which is still kept in place.

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>FAITH - Like TRUST but with elevated hands to show the trust is spiritual. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I've been walkin' on the long life journey, all my life. My feet are sore, my eyes are tired, all my life. But I know from the start, you are here in my heart. I will walk with you, Jesus. 

<P>2. I've been list'ning to your saving Word, all my life. And I shake long when I feel the thunder, all my life. Ooh! All my life. But I know from the start you are here in my heart. I will listen, Lord Jesus, all my life.

<P>3. I've been searchin' for the way you've called me, all my life. On the path I often fall and stumble, all my life, But I know from the start you are here in my heart. I will seek you, Lord Jesus.

<P>4. Your song is often hard to sing, all my life. And my voice gets tired when no one hears me, all my life. But I know from the start you are here in my heart. I will sing for you, Jesus, all my life.

<P>5. I've heard your call to heal and serve, all my life. And I find it hard to keep the faith, all my life. But I know from the start you are here in my heart. I will seek/serve you, Lord Jesus, all my life.
