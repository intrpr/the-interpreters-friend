<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The message of this song completely eludes me. I fail to see how it has anything to do with religious devotion! I have done my best to deal with the text.

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>UPS-AND-DOWNS - (2h)[Bb], POs down, FOs away, are held side-by-side.  DH tilts and moves up, then tilts and moves down.

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>YELL - [5:], PO > mouth, moves upwards from mouth. 

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.

<P>GIFT-TO-me - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands alt. flip thumb sides > signer.

<P>MEMORY - (2h)[U^], POs > back, FOs up, hands move in an outward arc from front of face to over the shoulder. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> All I ask of you is forever to remember me as loving you.

<P>1. Deep the joy of being together in one heart 
<BR>and for me that's just where it is.

<P>2. As we make our way through all the joys and pain, 
<BR>can we sense our younger, truer selves?

<P>3. Someone will be calling you to be there for a while. 
<BR>Can you hear their cry from deep within?

<P>4. Laughter, joy and presence: the only gifts you are! 
<BR>Have you time? I'd like to be with you.

<P>5. Persons come into the fiber of our lives 
<BR>and then their shadows fade and disappear. But...

<P>forever loving you.
