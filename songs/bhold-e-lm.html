<P><B>Refrain:</B> Behold the Lamb of God. Jesus is the Lamb of God.

<P>2. Surely he has borne our grief and carried the sorrows of us all. Struck down in our stead, rejected and scorned, and by his wounds we are healed.

<P>3. Father, forgive them; they do not understand. They do not understand what they do.

<P>4. The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of Christ, and he shall reign for endless days. Worthy is the Lamb.
