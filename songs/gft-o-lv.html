<P>IDEA~LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Gift of love, dawning bright, 
<BR>Pierces through endless night:
<BR>God of life, sharing might,
<BR>All creation holding,
<BR>Earth and sky enfolding.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Gift of love, love, love. 
<BR>Gift of love, love, love.
<BR>Glory be, Lord, to thee,
<BR>God of salvation.

<P>2. Thus he spoke from on high:
<BR>Choose to live or to die,
<BR>Love to give or deny --
<BR>Life and love now blending;
<BR>Love is life unending.

<P>3. Then he came on the earth,
<BR>Gift of love from his birth;
<BR>Shared our life, gave us worth;
<BR>To himself inviting,
<BR>God with us uniting.

<P>4. For our sake was he killed;
<BR>Once foretold, now fulfilled;
<BR>Love so great, be not stilled!
<BR>Beams of love he lifted,
<BR>And with life was gifted.
