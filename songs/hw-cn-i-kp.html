<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. My life flows on in endless song, above earth's lamentation. I hear the real though far-off hymn that hails a new creation.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: No storm can shake my inmost calm, while to that rock I'm clinging. Since love is Lord of heaven and earth, how can I keep from signing?

<P>2. Through all the tumult and the strife, I hear that music ringing; it sounds and echoes in my soul; how can I keep from singing? 

<P>3. What though the tempest round me roar, I hear the truth it liveth; what though the darkness 'round me close, songs in the night it giveth. 

<P>4. When tyrants tremble, sick with fear, and hear their death knells ringing; when friends rejoice both near and far, how can I keep from singing? 

<P>5. The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart, a fountain ever springing. All things are mine since I am his; how can I keep from singing?
