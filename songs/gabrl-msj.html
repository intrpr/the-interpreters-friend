<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>The angel Gabriel from Heaven came,
<BR>His wings as drifted snow, His eyes as flame; 
<BR>'All hail,' said he, 'Thou lowly maiden Mary,'
<BR>Most highly favoured lady, Gloria! 

<P>'For known a blessed Mother thou shalt be,
<BR>All generations laud and honour thee,
<BR>Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold,'
<BR>Most highly favoured lady, Gloria! 

<P>Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,
<BR>'To me be as it pleaseth God,' she said,
<BR>'My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name.'
<BR>Most highly favoured lady, Gloria! 

<P>Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born
<BR>In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,
<BR>And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say:
<BR>Most highly favoured lady, Gloria!
