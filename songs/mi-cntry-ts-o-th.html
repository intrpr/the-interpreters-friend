<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. My country, ’tis of thee,
<BR>Sweet land of liberty,
<BR>Of thee I sing;
<BR>Land where my fathers died,
<BR>Land of the pilgrims’ pride,
<BR>From every mountainside,
<BR>Let freedom ring!

<P>2. My native country, thee,
<BR>Land of the noble free,
<BR>Thy name I love;
<BR>I love thy rocks and rills,
<BR>Thy woods and templed hills;
<BR>My heart with rapture thrills,
<BR>Like that above.

<P>3. Let music swell the breeze,
<BR>And ring from all the trees,
<BR>Sweet freedom’s song;
<BR>Let mortal tongues awake;
<BR>Let all that breathe partake;
<BR>Let rocks their silence break,
<BR>The sound prolong.

<P>4. Our fathers’ God, to Thee,
<BR>Author of liberty,
<BR>To Thee we sing;
<BR>Long may our land be bright
<BR>With freedom’s holy light;
<BR>Protect us by Thy might,
<BR>Great God, our King.
