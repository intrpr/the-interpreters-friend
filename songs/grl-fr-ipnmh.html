<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> (&lt;) TALL, (>) TAN, (&lt;) YOUNG, (>) SHAPELY - Sway to left and then to right with each adjective. SHAPELY is the hearing gesture where (2h)[B] trace the outline of torso, waist, hips.

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>BRAZIL - [B], PO away, FO up, descends in a "Z" pattern.

<P>BEACH - NDH [Bb], PO down, FO away, acts as the shore line, and the DH [5], PO down, FO > NDS, wg while moving towards and spilling over onto the dorsal side (backhand) of the NDH, receding and spilling over again, like waves. 

<P>TAKE-WALK - [F], PO down, FO away, nods downwards while moving away.

<P>PASS-EACH-OTHER - (2h)[1], DH PO away, NDH PO > signer, FOs up, hands moves in the direction of the PO.

<P>LOOK-BACK - [V], PO down, FO and eyes look > NDS then both look away as if the eyes are now looking > center where the girl is.

<P>HAND-ON-HEART'ahhh' - put palm of [5] against heart as if taking in a deep breath while mouthin "ahhh!"

<P>SAMBA - Stand in place but (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, held high with head, torso, and hands swaying from side to side.

<P>HIPS-SWAY - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs away, with head and hands swaying from side to side.

<P>CRAZY-FOR - [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side.

<P>GIVE-HEART-TO - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, knuckles are curled so that hands make a valentine shape; this is held against heart and then brought forward. 

<P>STRAIGHT-AHEAD - Same as STRAIGHT.

<P>LOOK-AT-me - [V], PO down, FO away, FTs turn around and "look" at signer's face.

<P>ME++ - Poke chest with index finger several times.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Tall and tan and young and lovely, 
<BR>The girl from Ipanema goes walking, 
<BR>And when she passes each one she passes goes "a-a-ah!"
<BR>When she walks she's like a samba that, 
<BR>Swings so cool and sways so gentle, 
<BR>That when she passes each one she passes goes "a-a-ah!" 

<P>Oh, but I watch her so sadly, 
<BR>How can I tell her I love her?
<BR>Yes, I would give my heart gladly. 
<BR>But each day when she walks to the sea, 
<BR>She looks straight ahead not at me

<P>Tall and tan and young and lovely,
<BR>The girl from Ipanema goes walking, 
<BR>And when she passes I smile, but she doesn't see, 
<BR>She just doesn't see, No she doesn't see.
