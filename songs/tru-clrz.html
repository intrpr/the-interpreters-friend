<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>You with the sad eyes.
<BR>Don't be discouraged.
<BR>Oh I realize,
<BR>it's hard to take courage
<BR>in a world full of people.
<BR>You can lose sight of it all.
<BR>And the darkness inside you,
<BR>can make you feel so small

<P>But I see your true colors
<BR>shining through.
<BR>I see your true colors,
<BR>and that's why I love you.
<BR>So don't be afraid to let them show
<BR>your true colors.
<BR>True colors are beautiful,
<BR>like a rainbow.

<P>Show me a smile then.
<BR>Don't be unhappy. Can't remember
<BR>when I last saw you laughing.
<BR>If this world makes you crazy,
<BR>and you've taken all you can bear,
<BR>you call me up,
<BR>Because you know I'll be there,

<P>And I'll see your true colors
<BR>shining through.
<BR>I see your true colors,
<BR>And that's why I love you.
<BR>So don't be afraid to let them show
<BR>your true colors.
<BR>True colors are beautiful,
<BR>like a rainbow.
