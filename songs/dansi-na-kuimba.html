<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> THAT'S-ALL - (2h)[5] quiver like NERVOUS and rise.  

<P>BEAT+ - (2h)[B], DH PO down slaps NDH PO up at wrist rhythmically.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk.

<P>PUSH-ASIDE - (2h)[B],  with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.  

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something.

<P>JOIN-us - Looks like JOIN but the DH is inserted from the other side of the NDH.
