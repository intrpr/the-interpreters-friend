<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Have you hear the sounds of the angel voices ringing out so sweetly, ringing out so clear? Have you seen the star shining out so brightly as a sign from God that Christ the Lord is here? Have you heard the news that they bring from heaven to the humble shepherds who have waited long? Gloria in excelsis Deo! Gloria in excelsis Deo! Hear the angels sing their joyful song. 

<P>2. He is come in peace in the winter's stillness, like a snowfall in the gentle night. He is come in joy. He is come in joy, like the sun at morning, filling all the world with radiance and with light. He is come in love as the child of Mary. In a simple stable we have seen his birth. Gloria in excelsis Deo! Gloria in excelsis Deo! Hear the angels singing 'Peace on earth'.

<P>3. He will bring new light. He will bring new light to a world in darkness, like a bright star shining in the skies above. He will bring new hope. He will bring new hope to the waiting nations. When he comes to reign in purity and love. Let the earth rejoice. Let the earth rejoice at the Saviour's coming. Let the heavens answer with the joyful morn: Gloria in excelsis Deo! Gloria in excelsis Deo! ||: Hear the angels singing, 'Christ is born'. :||
