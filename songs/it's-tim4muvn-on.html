<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> GROUP-MOVE - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are held close but not touching and move off together as if a group were traveling. 

<P>FROM-TIME-TO-TIME - [B^], PO > NDS, FO away, moves away in upward arcs. 

<P>ARRIVE"step by step" -  - (2h)[B^], POs > signer, FOs >&lt;, DH moves in stops and starts > NDH. 

<P>GO-AWAY - [5^], PO > signer, FO up, moves away while closing to [O^].

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.  

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side. 

<P>PAH - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>BRANCH-OUT"each" - (2h)[1], POs down, FOs away, are held along side one another and touching. The DH moves away and branches out to the DS, while the NDH does not move. This is repeated while the hands move from NDS to DS.

<P>JOIN-me - Looks like JOIN but the DH is inserted from the other side of the NDH. 

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A> 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>||: (3x, rt, lf, ctr)... - The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated three times, facing slightly right, then slightly left, and finally facing forward.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>We've travelled a long, long time together
<P>And there have been alot of good things on the way,
<P>But now, it's almost time for leavin'
<P>And the things I feel inside are very hard to say.
<P>But it's time for moving on, my friend; hold back all the tears and sorrow,
<P>It finally is time, to go our separate ways.
<P>And I want to wish you well, my friend,
<P>As we search for new tomorrows.
<P>Go, as you must, but please,
<P>Don't forget the yesterdays.
<P>Remember the dreams we dreamed together,
<P>All of the joys we shared at getting to today.
<P>Now just one time, before you leave,
<P>Reach out, and take my hand,
<P>And help me walk away.
<P>For it's time for moving on, my friend; hold back all the tears and sorrow,
<P>It finally is time, to go our separate ways.
<P>And I want to wish you well, my friend,
<P>As we search for new tomorrows.
<P>Go, as you must, but please... Don't forget the yesterdays.
