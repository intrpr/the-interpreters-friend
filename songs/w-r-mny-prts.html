<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: We are many parts. we are all one body, and the gifts we have we are given to share. May the Spirit of love make us one indeed; one, the love that we share, one, our hope in despair, one, the cross that we bear.

<P>1. God of all, we look to you, we would be your servants true, let us be your love to all the world.

<P>2. So my pain is pain to you, in your joy is my joy, too; all is brought together in the Lord.

<P>3. All you seekers great and small, seek the greatest gift of all; if you love, then you will know the Lord.
