<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>GO-ALONG'fast' - Like NEXT with hands leapfrogging over one another but signed faster than usual. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/p/W3049.htm">ASL browser - process</A>.

<P>GET-BENEFIT - Sometimes called TAKE-ADVANTAGE, but not the sign that can imply negativity. Here is means [5:], PO > signer, FOs > NDS, is laid at the end of the NDH fingers and moves  along the palm > the signer, ending by closing to an [S] and moving upwards.

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>UP++ - (2h)[B], POs up, FOs away, hands bend upwards at wrists repeatedly while rising with each bend.

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>GROUP-TOGETHER - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, hands are brought together as if pushing people/things together into a group.

<P>SAME-OLD-THING - (2h)[Y], POs down, FOs away, circle vertically and symmetrically in a plane parallel to the chest. 

<P>SECOND-NATURE - [5:], PO down, is held under the chin at the NDS and moves > DS while closing to [S].

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>#GO - [G], PO > NDS, FO away, moves > DS while closing to an [O^].

<P>GUT - [B^], PO > signers waist, FO down, FT tap waist on DS.

<P>SURROUND - [5], PO down, FO away, circles above NDH [1], PO > DS, FO up.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>||: I will seize the day! :|| When the dawn breaks forth from the night time sky, know that hope is on its way. 'Cause when the sky lights up you can hear me say: I will seize the day. 

<P>Yes, every day's a brand new start, bringing on brighter pathways! Lift up your voice and know you're on your way! Seize the day! Join in the force too powerful to sway. Seize the day! I will rejoice and I will seize the day!

<P> When the road well traveled turns to dust and in your heart you know. A better pathway is in store, but which way do you go? Just reach deep with yourself. Trust your heat, let your power flow! 

<P>Lift up your voice and know you're on your way! Seize the day! Join in the force too powerful to sway. Seize the day! I will rejoice and I will seize the day! 

<P>Always know that love surrounds you, even in parts unknown. Keep the faith, you'll never be alone! Lift up your voice and know you're on your way! Seize the day! Join in the force too powerful to sway. Seize the day! I will rejoice and I will seize the day! ||: (4x) I will seize the day! :||
