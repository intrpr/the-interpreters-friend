<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Infant holy, Infant lowly, for His bed a cattle stall;
<BR>Oxen lowing, little knowing, Christ the Babe is Lord of all.
<BR>Swift are winging angels singing, noels ringing, tidings bringing:
<BR>Christ the Babe is Lord of all.

<P>2. Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping vigil till the morning new
<BR>Saw the glory, heard the story, tidings of a Gospel true.
<BR>Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, praises voicing, greet the morrow:
<BR>Christ the Babe was born for you.
