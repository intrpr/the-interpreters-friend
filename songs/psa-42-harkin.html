<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>ANIMAL-DRINK - [5^], PO down, FO away, hand moves > mouth and closes mutliple times.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>LOOK-BACK - (2h)[H or V] are brought back over the shoulder, POs down, FOs back.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. As the deer longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for you, O God. My soul does thirst for the living God, when shall I come to see your face?

<P>2. My tears have fed me day and night, while some have said, "Where is your God?" But I recall as my soul pours dry, the days of praise within your house.

<P>3. Why do I mourn and toil within, when it is mine to hope in God? I shall again sing praise to him. He is my help; he is my house.
