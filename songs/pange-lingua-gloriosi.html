<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Sing, my tongue, the Savior's glory,
<BR>of His flesh the mystery sing;
<BR>of the Blood, all price exceeding,
<BR>shed by our immortal King,
<BR>destined, for the world's redemption,
<BR>from a noble womb to spring.

<P>2. Of a pure and spotless Virgin
<BR>born for us on earth below,
<BR>He, as Man, with man conversing,
<BR>stayed, the seeds of truth to sow;
<BR>then He closed in solemn order
<BR>wondrously His life of woe.

<P>3. On the night of that Last Supper,
<BR>seated with His chosen band,
<BR>He the Pascal victim eating,
<BR>first fulfills the Law's command;
<BR>then as Food to His Apostles
<BR>gives Himself with His own hand.

<P>4. Word-made-Flesh, the bread of nature
<BR>by His word to Flesh He turns;
<BR>wine into His Blood He changes;
<BR>what though sense no change discerns?
<BR>Only be the heart in earnest,
<BR>faith her lesson quickly learns.

<P>5. Down in adoration falling,
<BR>Lo! the sacred Host we hail;
<BR>Lo! o'er ancient forms departing,
<BR>newer rites of grace prevail;
<BR>faith for all defects supplying,
<BR>where the feeble senses fail.

<P>6. To the everlasting Father,
<BR>and the Son who reigns on high,
<BR>with the Holy Ghost proceeding
<BR>forth from Each eternally,
<BR>be salvation, honor, blessing,
<BR>might and endless majesty. Amen.
