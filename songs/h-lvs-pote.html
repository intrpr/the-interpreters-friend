<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>REDEEMER - R-FREE AGENT.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>EAT-UP-body - (2H)5:] touches FT to chest and close and open as they travel
up the chest, as if taking small bites of it, while gnashing the teeth with each bite.

<P>COME-#BACK - (2h)[B], POs > signer, FOs up, move > signer while changing to (2h)[C] and then (2h)[K]. 

<P><U>HE</U>-lf LIVES! (>) <U>HE</U>-lf LIVES! (|) <U>HE</U>-lf LIVES! - To relieve the eye boredom of repetition, the signer can turn > lf and sign this, then > rt, then forward.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>RESURRECT - [V], PO up, FO away, pronates and hops onto the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_resurrection.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Resurrection.</A>

<P>SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>VERY-FIRST - [1], PO down, FO away, supinates like the sign FIRST, but strikes the thumb of NDH [A dot], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/f/first.swf">ASL Pro: First.</A>  

<P>BLOSSOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I know that my Redeemer lives. 
<BR>||: (3x) He lives! :|| 
<BR>I know that my Redeemer lives, 
<BR>and at the last he will stand upon the earth. 
<BR>||: My flesh may be destroyed. :|| 
<BR>Yet from this body will I see God! 
<BR>My eyes will behold him. 

<P>I know that my Redeemer lives. 
<BR>||: (3x) He lives! :|| 
<BR>I know that my Redeemer lives, 
<BR>and at the last he will stand upon the earth. 

<P>For now is Christ risen, risen from the dead.
<BR>The first fruits of them that slept. 
<BR>Death has been destroyed, the victory complete 
<BR>through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

<P>I know that my Redeemer lives. 
<BR>||: (3x) He lives! :|| 
<BR>And at the last he will stand upon the earth. 
<BR>||: (5x) I know :|| that my Redeemer lives.
<BR>He lives.
