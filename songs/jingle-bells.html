<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Dashing through the snow 
<BR>In a one-horse open sleigh 
<BR>Through the fields we go 
<BR>Laughing all the way. 
<BR>Bells on bob-tail ring 
<BR>Making spirits bright 
<BR>What fun it is to ride and sing 
<BR>A sleighing song tonight. 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Jingle bells, jingle bells 
<BR>Jingle all the way, 
<BR>Oh what fun it is to ride 
<BR>In a one-horse open sleigh, O
<BR>Jingle bells, jingle bells 
<BR>Jingle all the way, 
<BR>Oh what fun it is to ride 
<BR>In a one-horse open sleigh.

<P>2. A day or two ago 
<BR>I thought I'd take a ride 
<BR>And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
<BR>Was seated by my side; 
<BR>The horse was lean and lank 
<BR>Misfortune seemed his lot, 
<BR>We ran into a drifted bank 
<BR>And there we got upsot.  

<P>3. A day or two ago 
<BR>The story I must tell 
<BR>I went out on the snow 
<BR>And on my back I fell; 
<BR>A gent was riding by 
<BR>In a one-horse open sleigh 
<BR>He laughed at me as 
<BR>I there sprawling laid 
<BR>But quickly drove away.  

<P>4. Now the ground is white, 
<BR>Go it while you're young, 
<BR>Take the girls along 
<BR>And sing this sleighing song. 
<BR>Just bet a bob-tailed bay, 
<BR>Two-forty as his speed, 
<BR>Hitch him to an open sleigh 
<BR>and crack! You'll take the lead.
