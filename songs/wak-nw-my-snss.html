<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Wake, now, my senses, and hear the earth call;
<BR>Feel the deep power of being in all;
<BR>Keep, with the web of creation your vow,
<BR>Giving, receiving as love shows us how.

<P>2. Wake, now my reason, reach out to the new;
<BR>Join with each pilgrim who quests for the true
<BR>Honor the beauty and wisdom of time;
<BR>Suffer thy limit, and praise the sublime.

<P>3. Wake, now, compassion, give heed to the cry;
<BR>Voices of suffering fill the wide sky;
<BR>Take as your neighbor both stranger and friend,
<BR>Praying and striving their hardship to end.

<P>4. Wake, now, my conscience, with justice thy guide
<BR>Join with all people whose rights are denied;
<BR>Take not for granted a privileged place;
<BR>God's love embraces the whole human race.

<P>5. Wake, now, my vision of ministry clear;
<BR>Brighten my pathway with radiance here;
<BR>Mingle my calling with all who will share;
<BR>Work toward a planet transformed by our care.
<BR>Wake, now, my senses and hear the earth call.
