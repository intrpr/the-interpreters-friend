<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
<BR>He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
<BR>He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
<BR>His truth is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

<P>2. I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
<BR>They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
<BR>I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
<BR>His day is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.

<P>3. I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;
<BR>"As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal";
<BR>Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,
<BR>Since God is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.

<P>4. He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
<BR>He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
<BR>Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;
<BR>Our God is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

<P>5. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
<BR>With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
<BR>As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;
<BR>[originally Élet us die to make men free]
<BR>While God is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.

<P>6. He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,
<BR>He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave;
<BR>So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave,
<BR>Our God is marching on.
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
<BR>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.
