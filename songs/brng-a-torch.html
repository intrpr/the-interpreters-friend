<P>1. Bring a torch, light Yule fires bright.

<BR>Ah! Ah! How radiant the Mother.
<BR>Ah! Ah! How brightly shines the Sun.

<P>2. Sing in praise of our gracious Lady.
<BR>Sing in praise of her glorious Son.
<BR>The wheel has turned, tis time for the new year.
<BR>Dance gaily; we shall welcome the Sun.
<BR>Ah! Ah! How radiant the Mother.
<BR>Ah! Ah! How brightly shines the Sun.
