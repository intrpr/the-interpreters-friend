<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Three days our world was broken; the Lord of life lay dead.
<BR>"Take up your cross," he told us who followed where he led.
<BR>Would we noe (?) hang in torment with thieves on ev'ry side, 
<BR>our Passover shattered, our hope crucified? 
<BR>Three days we hid in silence, in bitter fear and grief. 
<BR>Three days we clung together where he had washed our feet.

<P>2. Three days-- and on the third day the women came at dawn.
<BR>His tomb, they said, was empty, his broken body gone.
<BR>Who could believe their story? The dead do not arise, 
<BR>yet he walks among us, and with our own eyes 
<BR>we've seen him at this table; we've shared his bread and wine.
<BR>Hearts burning bright within us, we've seen his glory shine.

<P>3. Three days our world was broken and in an instant healed,
<BR>God's covenant of mercy in mystery revealed. 
<BR>Two thousand year are one day in God's eternal sight,
<BR>and yesterday's sorrows are this day's delight.
<BR>Though still Christ's body suffers, pierced daily by the sword,
<BR>yet death has no dominion; the risen Christ is Lord.
