<P><B>Refrain:</B> Like a little child my soul will rest in you, my soul will rest in you.

<P>1. My heart is not proud, my eyes do not seek the ways from above;
the things that are great. The marvels beyond are not what I need, for you
are my peace.

<P>2. Quiet and still, my soul is calm, in your sweet embrace, like mother and
child. My hope is in you, my heart is full, for you are my peace.

<P>3. As the deer that longs for the stream, my soul longs for you, to see your
face. To  you I will sing and offer my thanks, for you are my peace.
