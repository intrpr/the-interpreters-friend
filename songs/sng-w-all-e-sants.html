<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Sing with all the saints in glory, sing the resurrection song!
<BR>[originally Sing with all the sons of glory…]
<BR>Death and sorrow, earth’s dark story, to the former days belong.
<BR>All around the clouds are breaking, soon the storms of time shall cease;
<BR>In God’s likeness we, awaking, know the everlasting peace.

<P>2. O what glory, far exceeding all that eye has yet perceived!
<BR>Holiest hearts, for ages pleading, never that full joy conceived.
<BR>God has promised, Christ prepares it, there on high our welcome waits.
<BR>Every humble spirit shares it; Christ has passed th’eternal gates.

<P>3. Life eternal! heaven rejoices; Jesus lives, who once was dead.
<BR>Join we now the deathless voices; child of God, lift up your head!
<BR>Patriarchs from the distant ages, saints all longing for their heaven,
<BR>Prophets, psalmists, seers, and sages, all await the glory given.

<P>4. Life eternal! O what wonders crowd on faith; what joy unknown,
<BR>When, amidst earth’s closing thunders, saints shall stand before the throne!
<BR>O to enter that bright portal, see that glowing firmament;
<BR>Know, with Thee, O God immortal, “Jesus Christ Whom Thou has sent.”
