<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent Word! What more can he say than to you he has said?  To you who to Jesus have fled?

<P>2. "Fear not, I am with you, O be not dismayed, for I am your God and will 
still give you aid; I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand, upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand."

<P>3. "When through the deep waters I call you to go, the rivers of woe shall 
not you overflow; for I will be with you, your troubles to bless, and sanctify to you, your deepest distress."

<P>4. "The soul that on Jesus still leans for repose, I will not, I will not desert to its foes; that soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
