<P>HOLY++'higher each time'. LORD GOD POWERFUL, LORD GOD MIGHTY, LORD GOD POWERFUL, STRONG. (<) HEAVEN, (>) EARTH FULL YOUR GLORY. HOSANNA ADVANCED. HOSANNA, HOSANNA, HOSANNA ADVANCED. 

<P>BLESS, BLESS, BLESS HIMSELF COME-DOWN-FROM-lf REPRESENT-TO"all" LORD, REPRESENT-TO"all" LORD HIMSELF-rt. ||: HOSANNA, HOSANNA, HOSANNA ADVANCED. :||

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> MIGHTY - (2h)[S], POs > back of signer, FOs up, are held at NDS and fists descend, then repeat at DS.

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>HOSANNA -  Clap the hands once, then bring (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, down almost to the knees and make them circle up repeatedly in a plane normal (perpendicular) to the chest until they rise up to the level of the head. If you are interested in the word, itself, read on. From the Hebrew "Hoshia na (Save us, please)", but because of the scene of the Triumphal Entry (of Jesus into Jerusalem before the Crucifixion) where the crowd calls this out to him, this has been traditionally used as an exclamation of joy. I use an alteration of the sign for "Hallelujah/Alleluia!" 

<P>ADVANCED - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move upwards arcing towards the signer.  For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>  

<P>BLESS - (2h)[O^], POs >&lt;, held at mouth.  Hands are brought 	downwards while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/b/bless.swf">ASL Pro: Bless.</A> 

<P>COME-DOWN-FROM - [1], PO > signer, FO up, moves down from high above as if it were Jesus coming from Heaven.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of power, Lord God of might, Lord God of power and might. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.

<P>Blessed, blessed, blessed is he who comes in the name, who comes in the Lord's own name. Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
