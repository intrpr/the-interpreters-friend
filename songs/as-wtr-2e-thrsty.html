<P>1. As water to the thirsty, as beauty to the eyes, 
<BR>as strength that follows weakness, as truth instead of lies, 
<BR>as song time and springtime and summertime to be, 
<BR>so is my Lord, my living Lord so is my Lord to me.

<P>2. Like calm in place of clamour, like peace that follows pain, 
<BR>like meeting after parting, like sunshine after rain, 
<BR>like moonlight and starlight on the sea, 
<BR>so is my Lord, my living Lord so is my Lord to me.

<P>3. Instrumental solo.

<P>4. As sleep that follows fever, as gold instead of grey, 
<BR>as freedom after bondage, as sunshine to the day, 
<BR>as home to the traveller and all we long to see, 
<BR>so is my Lord, my living Lord so is my Lord to me.
