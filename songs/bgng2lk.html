<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
<BR>Ev'rywhere you go; 
<BR>Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again 
<BR>With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 
<BR>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
<BR>Toys in ev'ry store, 
<BR>But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
<BR>On your own front door. 

<P>A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
<BR>Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
<BR>Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
<BR>Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
<BR>And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 

<P>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
<BR>Ev'rywhere you go; 
<BR>There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
<BR>The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
<BR>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
<BR>Soon the bells will start, 
<BR>And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
<BR>Right within your heart.
