<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> GOD SAY, COME-TO-me <U>ME</U>. <U>ME</U> WILL MAKE (2h)<U>YOU</U> PRECIOUS LIKE DIAMOND, NAME~SHINY. ||: (2h)<U>YOU</U> WILL SIT-IN-SEMICIRCLE IDEA~LIKE MY CROWN. :||

<P>1. SOME THINGS ONLY YOU"each" CAN DO. SOME WORDS ONLY YOU"each" CAN SAY. TRUST <U>ME</U>, DON'T TREMBLE. WHY? <U>ME</U> WILLING GO-WITH (2h)<U>YOU</U>, SHOW"all" (2h)<U>YOU</U> RIGHT WAY. <B>Refrain</B> 

<P>2. LONG-AGO <U>ME</U> MAKE WORLD, DECIDE SUFFER CALVARY. <U>ME</U> CHOOSE HELP"all" (2h)<U>YOU</U>. GIVE-UP MY LIFE. THRILLED (2h)<U>YOU</U> MY #OWN. <B>Refrain</B>

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-TO-me - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to come.

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>PRECIOUS - (2h)[5:], hold FTs by the sides of the chin and move down while maintaining contact and closing to (2h)[S]. 

<P>NAME~SHINY - starts like the sign NAME, the NDH - left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.  

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>SIT-IN-SEMICIRCLE - (2h)[4:], POs > signer, FOs up, hands are held together and separate tracing a semicircle so that the hands end up at either side of the head.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>CROWN - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) place crown on head with large single movement. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/c/crown.swf">ASL Pro: Crown.</A> 

<P>YOU"each" - [1^] sweeps from NDS to DS while jabbing to show each individual is different. 

<P>TREMBLE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands vibrate from side to side symmetrically to show legs shaking.

<P>CALVARY - MOUNTAIN + POSITIVE held high as if it were a cross on top of the mountain just indicated.

<P>#OWN - Fingerspelled but it twists > signer when the "W" is produced.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Come, come unto me; I will make you a jewel. Precious and rare the glory you'll bear in the crown of God.

<P>1. There are deeds you alone must do; there are words only you can say. Trust in me, and do not tremble, for I go with you to show you the way.

<P>2. From the dawn of creation, from the tree on Calvary, I chose you and gave my life to be my own, to be my delight.
