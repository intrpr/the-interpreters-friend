<HR><P><B>Notes:</B> Underlined prounouns (<U>ME</>, <U>YOU</>, <U>HE</U>) are honorific index (HON.-IX), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>GO-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DH is held ahead of NDH, then NDH leapfrogs over DH, and DH over NDH.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/P/W3047.htm">ASL browser - procedure</A>.

<P>LOOK-BACK - (2h)[H or V] are brought back over the shoulder, POs down, FOs back.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P>OBSESS - [1] touches temple and then changes to an [open 8] and touches the back of [5], PO down, while both move in circles together. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which - signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>A-TO-Z - [5], PO > signer, FO up, DH [A] - held at the thumb of the NDH and then moves > DS while tracing a [Z] at the little finger.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: I will remember you.
<BR>Will you remember me?
<BR>Don't let your life pass you by.
<BR>Weep not for the memories.
<BR>I'm so tired, but I can't sleep.

<P>1. Standing on the edge of something much too deep. 
<BR>It's funny how I feel so much but cannot say a word. 
<BR>Though we are screaming inside or we can't be heard. 

<P>2. I'll remember you.
<BR>I'll remember you.
<BR>I'm so afraid to love you,
<BR>I'm more afraid to lose,
<BR>Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose.
<BR>Well once there was a darkness,
<BR>A deep and endless night.
<BR>You gave me everything you had,
<BR>You gave me light.
<BR>And I will remember you.

<P><B>Coda:</B> I'll remember you.
<BR>I will remember you.
<BR>I'll remember.
<BR>Will you remember me?
<BR>Don't let your life pass you by
<BR>I'll remember you.
<BR>Weep not for the memories.
