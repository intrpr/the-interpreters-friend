<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>When He rolls up His sleeves He ain't just putting on the ritz
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!
<BR>There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!
<BR>The Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden
<BR>It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
<BR>His return is very close and so you better be believing that
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Our God is an awesome God
<BR>He reigns from Heaven above
<BR>With wisdom power and love
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!

<P>And when the sky was starless in the void of the night
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!
<BR>He spoke into the darkness and created the light
<BR>Our God is an awesome God!
<BR>Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom
<BR>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
<BR>I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
<BR>Our God is an awesome God! <B>Refrain</B>
