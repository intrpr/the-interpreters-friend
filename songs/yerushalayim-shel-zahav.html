<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> There are many verses and versions of this song.

<P>CLEAR LIKE WATER - The Hebrew is "zalul k'yayin - as comforting as wine", but I choose to be a bit free with my translation and more visual.

<P>FRAGRANCE - [5], PO down, FO > NDS, starts at NDS of body just under nose and moves > DS with wg while closing to [O^]. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>SURROUNDINGS - [5], PO down, FO away, circles above NDH [1], PO > DS, FO up.

<P>TINKLE - [5^], PO down, is shaken like a small bell. This is in reference to the small bells that the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) wore on his vestments.

<P>NOISE-DRIFT - (2h)[S] open to (2h)[5] and move with wg towards signer.

<P>COMES-INTO-BEING - (2h)[5:], POs down, interlock fingers and move knuckles up so that POs face each other.

<P>PLACED@rt - [5:], PO away, FO up, twists and descends to PO down, FO away.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>YERUSHALAYIM - The Israeli sign for "Jerusalem" is [B with thumbs flush with other fingers but not folded into palm], touches mouth and then pronates so that PO is away. 

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>HARP - The Hebrew is "kinor" which was the harp that King David used. You will see this translated as "lute" or "violin" in some versions.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>WELLS - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs away, rise from below to show the shape of a well. 

<P>FILLED-UP - [B], PO down, FO > NDS, is held close to body, starts rising from below waist and strikes chin in its rising. 

<P>REJOICE - CELEBRATE.

<P>TEMPLE - [T], PO down, FO away, taps dorsal [back] side of [S], PO down, FO > DS.

<P>SHOFAR - (2h)[S] is held close to the lips as if blowing a shofar (ram's horn).  The DH, which is further from the mouth, moves away and up, changing to a [5:] in imitation of the shofar's shape. 

<P>BLAST - NDH [S] is held at the lips and DH [C], PO away, FO up, is held like the end of a ram's horn. Both hands vibrate.

<P>CAVE'long' - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FOs up, travel away in a wavy line to show a cave passage.

<P>GLOW - (2h)[5^], POs away, FOs up, open and close as if glowing. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>YAM HAMELACH - The "Sea of Salt" which we call in English the "Dead Sea". The Israeli sign for this is SWIM + [F], PO down, FO away, rubs index finger against thumb as if sprinkling salt (hand stays in place).

<P>JORDAN - The song mentions "Jerico", but I don't know the Israeli sign for that, so I choose the Israeli sign for "Jordan" which does empty into the Dead Sea.

<P>CROWN - (2h)[L:] (like BIG) moves crown from head to netural space. 

<P>NOTHING-TO-IT - (2h)[F], POs away, FOs up, hands move slightly and symetrically from side to side.

<P>POETS - [O^], FO down is held against chest and moves up and away similar to the sign EXPRESS + AGENT. 

<P>body-BURN - In reference to the seraphim (the burning ones), (2h)[5] travel up chest with wg.

<P>CHERISH - (2h)[5:], hold FTs by the sides of the chin and move down while maintaining contact and closing to (2h)[S]. 
 	 
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>  

<P>1. The mountain air is clear as wine 
<BR>The scent of pines around 
<BR>Is carried on the breeze of twilight, 
<BR>And tinkling bells resound. 
<BR>The trees and stones there softly slumber, 
<BR>A dream enfolds them all. 
<BR>So solitary lies the city, 
<BR>And at its heart -- a wall.
 	 
<P><B>Refrain:</B> Oh, Jerusalem of gold, 
<BR>and of light and of bronze, 
<BR>I am the lute for all your songs. 

<P>2. The wells are filled again with water, 
<BR>The square with joyous crowd, 
<BR>On the Temple Mount within the City, 
<BR>The shofar rings out loud. 
<BR>Within the caverns in the mountains 
<BR>A thousand suns will glow, 
<BR>We'll take the Dead Sea road together, 
<BR>That runs through Jericho. <B>Refrain</B>
 	 
<P>3. But as I sing to you, my city, 
<BR>And you with crowns adorn, 
<BR>I am the least of all your children, 
<BR>Of all the poets born. 
<BR>Your name will scorch my lips for ever, 
<BR>Like a seraph's kiss, I'm told, 
<BR>If I forget thee, golden city, 
<BR>Jerusalem of gold. <B>Refrain</B>
