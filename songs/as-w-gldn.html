<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. As with gladness, men of old
<BR>Did the guiding star behold
<BR>As with joy they hailed its light
<BR>Leading onward, beaming bright
<BR>So, most glorious Lord, may we
<BR>Evermore be led to Thee.

<P>2. As with joyful steps they sped
<BR>To that lowly manger bed
<BR>There to bend the knee before
<BR>Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;
<BR>So may we with willing feet
<BR>Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

<P>3. As they offered gifts most rare
<BR>At that manger rude and bare;
<BR>So may we with holy joy,
<BR>Pure and free from sin’s alloy,
<BR>All our costliest treasures bring,
<BR>Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

<P>4. Holy Jesus, every day
<BR>Keep us in the narrow way;
<BR>And, when earthly things are past,
<BR>Bring our ransomed souls at last
<BR>Where they need no star to guide,
<BR>Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

<P>[Some use this version of v. 4:
<BR>Christ Redeemer, with us stay,
<BR>Help us live your holy way.
<BR>And when earthly things are past,
<BR>Bring our ransomed souls at last
<BR>Where they need no star to guide,
<BR>Where no clouds your glory hide.]

<P>5. In the heavenly country bright,
<BR>Need they no created light;
<BR>Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
<BR>Thou its Sun which goes not down;
<BR>There forever may we sing
<BR>Alleluias to our King!
