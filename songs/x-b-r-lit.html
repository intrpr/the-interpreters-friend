<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Longing for light, we wait in darkness.
<BR>Longing for truth, we turn to you.
<BR>Make us your own, your holy people,
<BR>Light for the world to see.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Christ, be our light! Shine in our hearts.
<BR>Shine through the darkness.
<BR>Christ, be our light! Shine in your Church
<BR>Gathered today.

<P>2. Longing for peace, our world is troubled.
<BR>Longing for hope, many despair.
<BR>Your word alone has power to save us
<BR>Make us your living voice. 

<P>3. Longing for food, many are hungry.
<BR>Longing for water, many still thirst.
<BR>Make us your bread, broken for others,
<BR>Shared until all are fed. 

<P>4. Longing for shelter people are homeless.
<BR>Longing for warmth, many are cold.
<BR>Make us your building, sheltering others,
<BR>Walls made of living stone. 

<P>5. Many the gifts, many the people,
<BR>Many the hearts that yearn to belong.
<BR>Let us be servants to one another,
<BR>Making your kingdom come.
