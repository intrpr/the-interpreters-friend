<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B>
In these days of Lenten journey we have seen and we have heard the call to sow justice in the lives of those we serve.

<P>1. We reach out to those who are homeless, to those who live without warmth. In the coolness of evening we'll shelter their dreams; we will clothe them in mercy and peace. 

<P>2. We open our eyes to the hungry and see the faces of Christ. As we nourish all people who hunger for food, may their faith in our God be renewed. 

<P>3. We open our ears to the weary and hear the cry of the poor. To the voices that echo the song of despair, we will show our compassion and care. 

<P>4. We call on the Spirit of Justice and pray for righteousness' sake. We will sing for the freedom of all the oppressed; we will loosen the bonds of distress.
