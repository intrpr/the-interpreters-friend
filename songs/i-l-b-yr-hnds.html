<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. You walked the earth so long ago, that we forget what you did for us; with a touch you healed all wounds, reaching out with your hands. You live on in what I do. I continue your work for you:

<P><B>Refrain:</B> I will be your hands, Lord, to pick up my fallen sister, to wipe the tears of my brother. I will be your hands, Lord. In the night I heard you call. I am here my Lord to be your hands. [After verse 3, this is sung twice.]

<P>2. Use my hands to feed the poor. Use my hands to throw a stone down. Use my hands to save a child. Use my hands to build your kingdom. You live on in what I do, my voice to sing your praise, my heart to love you! 

<P>3. You have set me as a jewel to light the way, to bring all home to you. I am here; use my hands. You are my way, my truth, my life, my source of strength, my rock, my shield of love. Use my hands,; I am here, Lord!
