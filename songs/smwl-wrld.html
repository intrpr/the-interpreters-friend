<P>1. It's a world of laughter, 
<BR>A world of tears. 
<BR>It's a world of hopes, 
<BR>And a world of fears. 
<BR>There's so much that we share, 
<BR>That it's time we're aware. 
<BR>It's a small world after all.

<P>2. There is just one moon, 
<BR>And one golden sun,
<BR>And a smile means 
<BR>Friendship to everyone. 
<BR>Though the mountains divide, 
<BR>And the oceans are wide, 
<BR>It's a small world after all.  

<P><B>Refrain:</B> It's a small world after all.
<BR>It's a small world after all. 
<BR>It's a small world after all. 
<BR>It's a small, small world.
