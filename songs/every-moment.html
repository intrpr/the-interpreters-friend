<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BELLY-LAUGH - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DH is above NDH and they move alt. to and fro like a vibrating belly. 

<P>SO-MUCH - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, separate while "so much" is mouthed. 

<P>TEARS - (2h)[X] scratches downward slightly on face under eyes. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>SAME-SAME - (2h)[Y], POs down, FOs away, circle vertically and symmetrically in a plane parallel to the chest. 

<P>alt.GO - (2h)[5^], PO > signer, FO up, alt. move away from while closing to [O^]. 

<P>SO - (2h)[relaxed 5], supinate (POs from downwards to upwards in a loose way.

<P>LET-GO - DISCONNECT.

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.  

<P>HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH is held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/heavenlyfather_a.swf">ASL Pro: Heavenly Father - 1.</A>  

<P>IDEA-LIKE - A blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>GO-AWAY - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, nod hands down, then up, with a movement of the arms to show that something is being swept away.
    
<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>We laughed out loud 'til we cried 
<BR>And the tears were sweet.
<BR>Midnight melted to morning.
<BR>A moment faded to memory.
<BR>All these days 
<BR>They just slip away through our fingers. 
<BR>So... 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Don't let go. 
<BR>Hold onto every moment. 
<BR>Always know 
<BR>Hold onto every moment that You can. 

<P>We move on with no regrets to our destiny 
<BR>Held by the hands of the Father. 
<BR>We share His love and He leads us through 
<BR>All these days. 
<BR>They just slip away through our fingers. 
<BR>So... <B>Refrain</B>

<P>Running through yesterday into tomorrow 
<BR>Don't let it just drift away. 
<BR>Forget about tying the hands of time.
<BR>Give every minute to the One who gave us today. <B>Refrain</B>
