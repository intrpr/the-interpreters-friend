<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Hark! The herald angels sing,
<BR>"Glory to the newborn King;
<BR>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
<BR>God and sinners reconciled!"
<BR>Joyful, all ye nations rise,
<BR>Join the triumph of the skies;
<BR>With th'angelic host proclaim,
<BR>"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Hark! the herald angels sing,
<BR>"Glory to the newborn King!"

<P>2. Christ, by highest Heav'n adored;
<BR>Christ the everlasting Lord;
<BR>Late in time, behold Him come,
<BR>Offspring of a virgin's womb.
<BR>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
<BR>Hail th'incarnate Deity,
<BR>Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
<BR>Jesus our Emmanuel.

<P>3. Hail the heav'nly Prince of Peace!
<BR>Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
<BR>Light and life to all He brings,
<BR>Ris'n with healing in His wings.
<BR>Mild He lays His glory by,
<BR>Born that man no more may die.
<BR>Born to raise the sons of earth,
<BR>Born to give them second birth.

<P>4. Come, Desire of nations, come,
<BR>Fix in us Thy humble home;
<BR>Rise, the woman's conqu'ring Seed,
<BR>Bruise in us the serpent's head.
<BR>Now display Thy saving power,
<BR>Ruined nature now restore;
<BR>Now in mystic union join
<BR>Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.

<P>5. Adam's likeness, Lord, efface,
<BR>Stamp Thine image in its place:
<BR>Second Adam from above,
<BR>Reinstate us in Thy love.
<BR>Let us Thee, though lost, regain,
<BR>Thee, the Life, the inner man:
<BR>O, to all Thyself impart,
<BR>Formed in each believing heart.
