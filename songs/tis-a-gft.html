<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist. 

<P>PAH - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>'Tis a gift to be simple
<BR>'Tis a gift to be free
<BR>'Tis a gift to come down 
<BR>Where we ought to be 
<BR>And when we find ourselves 
<BR>In that place just right
<BR>We will be in the valley
<BR>Of Love and delight. 

<P>When the true simplicity
<BR>Is gained 
<BR>To bow and to bend 
<BR>We shall not be ashamed 
<BR>To turn and to turn it will 
<BR>Be our delight 
<BR>'Till by turning and turning we
<BR>Come 'round right.
