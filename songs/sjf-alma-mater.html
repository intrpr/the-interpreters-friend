<P>1. <U>YOU</U> MOTHER COLLEGE, PLEASE GUIDE US EVERY WAY. 
<BR>WE THRILLED HONOR <U>YOU</U>. YOUR NAME WE PRAISE. 
<BR>WE CHERISH YOUR BUILDLING+. WHY? INSIDE WE LEARN THROUGH FAITH PURE LIGHT. 
<BR>OUR LIFE ITSELF WE OFFER-UP (pause) FOR GOD, FOR TRUTH, FOR RIGHT.

<P>2. WE S-J-F STUDENT ALWAYS STEADFAST. 
<BR>WITH FAITH OUR SHIELD AND ARMOR FIGHT BAD INFLUENCE ANY PLACE. 
<BR>WE REMEMBER THAT GOAL ALWAYS. SAME HERE OR FAR-AWAY. 
<BR>S-J-F STUDENT ALWAYS LIVE (pause) FOR RIGHT, FOR TRUTH, FOR GOD.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity. 

<P>STEADFAST - Elbow of DH [S] is placed firmly in the palm of NDH [B].

<P>SHIELD - NDH [B], PO > signer, FO > DS, is held close to the body, and the DH is [5], PO away, FO up, and held further away.  The DH circles CCW as seen by signer as if there is something there to be shielded from.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/S/W3591.htm">ASL browser - shield</A>.

<P>ARMOR - (2h)[B^], POs > face, FOs >&lt;, DH taps on NDH from above like WINDOW but is held close to the face to mimic the visor of a suit of armor. 

<P><B>Lyrics:</B>

<P>1. Ave, Alma Mater!
<BR>Guide In all our ways,
<BR>We joyfully salute you
<BR>And hail your name with praise.
<BR>Beneath your hallowed towers,
<BR>We learned in faith's pure light
<BR>To dedicate our very lives
<BR>To God, to Truth, to Right. 

<P>2. Loyal Fisher students
<BR>Ever steadfast stand
<BR>With faith our shield and armor
<BR>'Gainst evil's hostile hand.
<BR>Be this the thought to guide us
<BR>At home or far abroad
<BR>That Fisher students ever live
<BR>For right, for Truth, for God.
