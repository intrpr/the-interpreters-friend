<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Whence that goodly fragrance flowing,
<BR>Stealing our senses all away?
<BR>Never the like did come a blowing,
<BR>Shepherds, from flow'ry fields in May.

<P>2. What is that light so brilliant,
<BR>Breaking here in the night across our eyes?
<BR>Never so bright the day-star waking
<BR>Started to climb the morning skies!

<P>3. Bethlehem! There in manger lying
<BR>Find your redeemer, haste away!
<BR>Run ye with eager footsteps hieing!
<BR>Worship the Savior born today!
