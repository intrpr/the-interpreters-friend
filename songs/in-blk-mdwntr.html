<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In the bleak midwinter,
<BR>Frosty wind made moan. 
<BR>Earth stood hard as iron,
<BR>Water like stone.
<BR>Snow had fallen snow on snow,
<BR>Snow on snow.
<BR>In the beak midwinter long ago.

<P>2. Our God, Heav'n cannot hold Him,
<BR>Nor earth sustain.
<BR>Heav'n and earth shall flee away,
<BR>When He comes to reign,
<BR>In the bleak midwinter,
<BR>A stable place suffic'd
<BR>The Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ.

<P>3. Enough for Him, whom cherubin
<BR>Worship night and day,
<BR>A breast full of milk,
<BR>And a manger full of hay.
<BR>Enough for Him, whom angels
<BR>Fall down before,
<BR>The ox and ass and camel
<BR>Which adore.

<P>4. What can I give Him,
<BR>Poor as I am?
<BR>If I were a shepherd,
<BR>I would bring a lamb.
<BR>If I were a wise man, 
<BR>I would do my part.
<BR>Yet what I can give Him,
<BR>Give my heart, give, give my heart.
