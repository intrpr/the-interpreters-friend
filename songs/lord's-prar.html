<P>OUR HEAVENLY-FATHER, YOURSELF LIVE HEAVEN. YOUR NAME HOLY. YOUR KINGDOM COME, YOUR REALLY-WANT HAPPEN HERE EARTH earth-SAME-AS-Heaven. GIFT-TO-us TODAY OUR DAILY BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBT, LIKE WE FORGIVE <U>THOSE</U>-rt OWE US. BRING US NOT TRIAL, BUT SAVE US, NO BAD*. (Some versions add:) WHY? KINGDOM, POWER, GLORY, YOURS FROM-NOW-ON FOREVER. AMEN.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH - held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/heavenlyfather_a.swf">ASL Pro: Heavenly Father - 1.</A>

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy  - 1.</A>

<P>KINGDOM - KING + [5], PO down, FO away, circles horizontally. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>GIFT-TO-us - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands tip back towards signer to show that something is given as a gift. 

<P>DEBT - [1^] pokes upturned palm several times. I used to translate "trespass" as SIN, but the reason some translations have "debts" is because the term "trespass" really means monetary damages that are owed a person due to inflicting harm on her/him. This is also more appropriate at AA meetings, where this prayer is used, to deemphasize the religious elelment, along the lines of "a Power greater than ourselves" (Twelve steps of AA).

<P><U>THOSE</U>-rt - [B], PO up, FO > rt, sweeps > DS. 

<P>BRING US NOT TRIAL - Is one of the extant translations that makes a lot more sense than "lead us not into temptation".

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A>

<P>FROM-NOW-ON - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, DHFT touches knuckle side of NDHFT and moves away in a downward arc. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1382.htm">ASL browser - from now on</A>.   

<P>AMEN - (2h)[B], FOs up, are pressed together and brought down in a long, deliberate motion. </B> For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&Letter=A">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Amen.</A>

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. (Some versions add:) For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
