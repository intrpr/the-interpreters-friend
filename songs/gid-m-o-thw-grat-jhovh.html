<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah [or Redeemer]
<BR>Pilgrim through this barren land.
<BR>I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
<BR>Hold me with Thy powerful hand.
<BR>Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven,
<BR>Feed me till I want no more;
<BR>Feed me till I want no more.

<P>2. Open now the crystal fountain,
<BR>Whence the healing stream doth flow;
<BR>Let the fire and cloudy pillar
<BR>Lead me all my journey through.
<BR>Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
<BR>Be Thou still my Strength and Shield;
<BR>Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

<P>3. Lord, I trust Thy mighty power,
<BR>Wondrous are Thy works of old;
<BR>Thou deliver'st Thine from thralldom,
<BR>Who for naught themselves had sold:
<BR>Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer,
<BR>Sin, and Satan and the grave,
<BR>Sin, and Satan and the grave.

<P>4. When I tread the verge of Jordan,
<BR>Bid my anxious fears subside;
<BR>Death of deaths, and hell's destruction,
<BR>Land me safe on Canaan's side.
<BR>Songs of praises, songs of praises,
<BR>I will ever give to Thee;
<BR>I will ever give to Thee.

<P>5. Musing on my habitation,
<BR>Musing on my heav'nly home,
<BR>Fills my soul with holy longings:
<BR>Come, my Jesus, quickly come;
<BR>Vanity is all I see;
<BR>Lord, I long to be with Thee!
<BR>Lord, I long to be with Thee!
