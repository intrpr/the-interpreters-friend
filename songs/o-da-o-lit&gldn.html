<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O day of light and gladness,
<BR>Of prophecy and song,
<BR>What thoughts within us waken,
<BR>What hallowed memories throng!
<BR>The soul’s horizon widens,
<BR>Past, present, future blend;
<BR>And rises on our vision
<BR>The life that hath no end.

<P>2. Earth feels the season’s joyance,
<BR>From mountain range to sea
<BR>The tides of life are flowing
<BR>Fresh, manifold and free.
<BR>In valley and on upland,
<BR>By forest pathways dim,
<BR>All nature lifts in chorus
<BR>The resurrection hymn.

<P>3. O Lord of life eternal,
<BR>To Thee our hearts upraise
<BR>The Easter song of gladness,
<BR>The Passover of praise.
<BR>Thine are the many mansions,
<BR>The dead die not to Thee,
<BR>Who fillest from Thy fullness
<BR>Time and eternity.
