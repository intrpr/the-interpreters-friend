<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I have traveled many moonless nights,
<BR>Cold and weary with a babe inside,
<BR>And i wonder what i've done.
<BR>Holy father you have come,
<BR>And chosen me now to carry your son.

<P>I am waiting in a silent prayer.
<BR>I am frightened by the load i bear.
<BR>In a world as cold as stone,
<BR>Must i walk this path alone?
<BR>||: Be with me now. :||

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Breath of heaven,
<BR>Hold me together,
<BR>Be forever near me,
<BR>Breath of heaven.
<BR>Breath of heaven,
<BR>Lighten my darkness,
<BR>Pour over me your holiness,
<BR>For you are holy.
<BR>Breath of heaven.

<P>Do you wonder as you watch my face,
<BR>If a wiser one should have had my place,
<BR>But I offer all I am
<BR>For the mercy of your plan.
<BR>Help me be strong.
<BR>Help me be.
<BR>Help me. 

<P>||: <B>Refrain</B> :||
