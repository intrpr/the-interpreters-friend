<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>FEAR - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, hands are held far from body and move back to body in a wavy pattern. 

<P>ONE* - [1^], PO up, FO away, moves upward rapidly until PO > singer, FO up.  

<P>REALLY-WANT - the sign WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>WITNESS - [1] touches under eye while head moves down. 

<P>KIND - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.

<P>SPIRITED - (2h)[S], fists held close to upperchest, elbows are thrust out to the side twice as if feeling energetic.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain</B>: The Lord is my light and my salvation, of whom shall I be afraid? 
          
<P>1. The Lord is my light and my help; whom should I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; before whom should I shrink?

<P>2. There is one thing I ask of the Lord; for this I long; to live in the house of the Lord all the days of  my life.

<P>3. I believe I shall see the goodness of the Lord, in the land of the living; hope in him and take heart, hope in the Lord!
