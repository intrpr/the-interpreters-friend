<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> LOOK-FORWARD - Same as LOOK-UP-TO. 

<P>RIGHT-HERE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands descend 1x or 2x. 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>BELOW - [1^], PO down, FO away, descends in a curvy patternt to show "way down there". 

<P>SWEETIE - SWEET.

<P>[SWIM] AROUND - (2h)[1], POs > signer, circle around each other while both hands move > DS. 

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>CRASH - NDH [B], PO > DS, FO up, acts as the rocks, and the DH [5], PO > NDS, FO up, crashes against it, wg as it moves up and recedes. Repeat.

<P>FLIP-PAN - Mime holding a pan and flipping a fish that is cooking in it.

<P>HAVE-NO - (2h)[B], POs > signer move upwards past mouth and swing upwards and apart while mouth blows on hands as they pass. 

<P>HOOK - Hook [X] into side of mouth.

<P>BUBBLES - (2h)[S], POs up, FOs away, alt. move up like juggling, opening to [5:] and then closing again.

<P>(newt) - It is imposible to capture all the puns and impractical to fingerspell the series of animals, so I used undersea animals that have signs and tried to pick a musical activity that would look humorous if that animal did it. Since this will make it harder to keep one's place, I have included key words in parentheses before the signed line to help.  

<P>SQUID - Sign looks like AND signed twice while moving > DS, but not closing completely. 

<P>PLAY-CLARINET - For these and other musical insturment, mime how they are played.

<P>COOL - FINEwg.

<P>WHALE - (2h)[B], horizontal NDS arm represents the surface of an ocean. The movement of the DH shows a whale diving in and out of the water > NDS. This sign can be done with DH [W].

<P>TOOTHY-SMILE - (2h)[5:], POs >&l;t, FOs > NDS, with DH on top of NDH. The hands sweep in a semi-circle > DS as if showing the range of teeth.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>The seaweed is always greener
<BR>In somebody else's lake.
<BR>You  dream about going up there,
<BR>But that is a big mistake.
<BR>Just look at the world around you,
<BR>Right here on the ocean floor.
<BR>Such wonderful things surround you.
<BR>What more is you lookin' for?

<P>Under the sea, under the sea,
<BR>Darling it's better down where it's wetter,
<BR>Take it from me.
<BR>Up on the shore they work all day.
<BR>Out in the sun they slave away,
<BR>While we devotin' time to go floatin' 
<BR>Under the sea.

<P>Down here all the fish is happy,
<BR>As off through the waves they roll.
<BR>The fish on the land ain't happy.
<BR>They sad 'cause they in their bowl,
<BR>But fish in the bowl is lucky.
<BR>They in for a worser fate.
<BR>One day when the boss get hungry,
<BR>Guess who's gon' be on the plate?

<P>Under the sea, under the sea,
<BR>Darling it's better down where it's wetter,
<BR>Take it from me.
<BR>We what the land folks loves to cook.
<BR>Under the sea we off the hook.
<BR>We got no troubles; life is the bubbles
<BR>Under the sea. 

<P>The newt play the flute. The carp play the harp.
<BR>The plaice play the bass, And they soundin' sharp.
<BR>The bass play the brass. The chub play the tub.
<BR>The fluke is the duke of soul. (Yeah)
<BR>The ray he can play. The lings on the strings.
<BR>The trout rockin' out. The blackfish she sings.
<BR>The smelt and the sprat, they know where it's at,
<BR>An' oh that blowfish blow.

<P>Under the sea, under the sea,
<BR>Darling it's better down where it's wetter,
<BR>Take it from me.
<BR>What do they got? A lot of sand.
<BR>We got a hot crustacean band.
<BR>Each little clam here know how to jam here
<BR>Under the sea.
<BR>Each little slug here cuttin' a rug here
<BR>Under the sea.
<BR>Each little snail here know how to wail here.
<BR>That's why it's hotter under the water.
<BR>Ya we in luck here down in the muck here
<BR>Under the sea.
