<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>If I might see another Spring
<BR>I'd listen to the daylight birds
<BR>That build their nests and pair and sing.
<BR>Nor wait for mateless nightingale;

<P>I'd listen to the lusty herds,
<BR>The ewes with lambs as white as snow,
<BR>I'd find out music in the hail
<BR>And all the winds that blow.

<P>If I might see another Spring
<BR>Oh stinging comment on my past
<BR>That all my past results in "if"
<BR>If I might see another Spring
<BR>I'd laugh today, today is brief;

<P>I would not wait for anything that cannot last, 
<BR>Be glad today and sing, and sing.
