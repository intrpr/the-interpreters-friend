<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>HAVE-MERCY-ON-me - (2h)[open 8], POs > signer, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/mercy_b.swf">ASL Pro: Mercy - 2.</A>

<P>SOFT-HEARTED - HEART + (2h)[5^] descend slightly twice while closing to (2h)[O^].

<P>PURE - like NICE but the DH moves backwards slightly on the palm, pauses, then moves forward rapidly to show intensity. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Have mercy on me, God, in your compassion. Remove my sin. Wash me from my guilt.

<P>2. O purify my heart and teach me wisdom; then I shall be cleaner than the snow.

<P>3. O give me back the joy of your salvation; a willing spirit sustain in me.
