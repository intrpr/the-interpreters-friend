<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> (2h)<U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>PAH - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>OFFER-SACRIFICE - For a more poetic sign, start with (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, twist hands so that little fingers approach each other and palms turn up, then bring hands upwards > Heaven.

<P>JUSTICE - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, tap FT while moving in a horizontal circle.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>MANY-LOOK-AT-me - (2h)[4], POs down, FOs away, hands turn FO > face as if many people were turning their gaze to the signer. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Here am I, O God. ||: I come to do your will. :|| 

<P>1. I waited for you, and you hear me, O God. You have put a new song in my mouth: a hymn of praise to the God of my salvation.

<P>2. You opened my ear to your word, O God. You take no delight in empty sacrifice. To do your will is my life and my delight, O God.

<P>3. I sing of your justice; I sing of your peace; I sing of your faithfulness and steadfast love; I chant your praise in the midst of all your people.
