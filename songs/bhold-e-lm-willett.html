<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Those who were in the dark are thankful for the sunlight; we who live, we who die are grateful for his gift, thankful for his love.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Behold the Lamb of God. All who eat, all who drink shall live, shall live; and all, all who dwell in God, in God shall come to know his glory. 

<P>2. Peaceful now, those whose hearts are blessed with understanding. Of the wheat, of the wine united with his word and the love we share.

<P>3. Gentle one, Child of God, join with us at this table. Bless our lives; nourish all who hunger for this feast; shelter them with peace.

<P>4. Lord of all, give us light. Deliver us from evil. Make us one; be our shield. Make still the winds that blow; cradle us with love.
