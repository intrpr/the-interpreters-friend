<P>1. GOD ORDAIN PROPHET AND THEY-lf TAKE-OFF.  THEY-lf REALLY-WANT (&lt;) MONEY, (>) FAMOUS, NOT.  CHRIST SUMMON, THEY-lf PAY-ATTENTION-above.  ONLY WANT INSIDE-SELF OFFER-UP.  

<P>2. WE PREACH"each" GOSPEL, DON'T-WANT MISUNDERSTAND.  WE HAPPY OUR SIN <U>HE</U> FORGIVE CAN.  OUR HOME HEAVEN.  IF SINNER HAVE WILLING SPIRIT ACCEPT CHRIST, LIVE NEW* CAN.

<P>3. WE SUPPORT EVERY GROUP JUSTICE.  WE USE OUR STRENGTH PROTECT THEIR-rt RIGHTS.  GREEDY, DISCRIMINATE, GO-AHEAD WAR, GOD LOOK-DOWN-ON DISGUSTED, DAMN THEM-rt WILL.

<P>4. TODAY WE GRADUATE, FINISH, PRAY #ALL-OF-US INTERACT CONNECT* FROM-NOW-ON.  PROPHET THEIR-lf TRUTH AND JESUS HIS LIGHT SHOULD SHOW-TO-us PATH RIGHT, DIVERT-TO-lf~DIVERT-TO-rt (2h)SAY-#NO. 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> ORDAIN is [B] touches temple and then NDH [B], PO down. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/O/W2644.htm">ASL browser - ordain</A>. 

<P>TAKE-OFF - Intensive form of DEVELOP.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - Hold the FT of [C] against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>#ALL-OF-US - [A], PO > NDS, FO up touches DS shoulder then [L^], PO > signer touches NDS shoulder.  

<P>DIVERT-TO-lf~DIVERT-TO-rt - Like OFF-THE-POINT travelling first to one side, and then the other. It's a way of saying "to sin".
