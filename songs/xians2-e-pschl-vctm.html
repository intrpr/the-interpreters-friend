<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Christians, praise the paschal victim! Offer thankful sacrifice! 

<P>2. Christ the Lamb has saved the sheep, Christ the just one paid the price. Reconciling sinners to the Father. 

<P>3. Death and life fought bitterly for this wondrous victory; The Lord of life who died reigns glorified! 

<P>4. O Mary, come and say what you saw at break of day. 

<P>5. "The empty tomb of my living Lord! I saw Christ Jesus risen and adored!" 

<P>6. Bright angels testified, shroud and grave clothes side by side! 

<P>7. "Yes, Christ my hope rose gloriously. He goes before you into Galilee." 

<P>8. Share the good news, sing joyfully: His death is victory! Lord Jesus, Victor King, show us mercy.
