<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.  
 
<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>VISUALIZE - (2h)[S] are held at forehead with DH closer to head, and hands open to (2h)[5] while separating while FT wg. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/v/vision_a.swf">ASL Pro: Vision - 1.</A> 

<P>CRUCIFY - Pinky side of [S] is "driven" into palm of [B], PO away, FO up, then vice versa. Notice the difference from CRUCIFIED. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=17">ASL browser - crucify</A>.

<P>CRAZY-FOR LOOK-BACK - This is meant to be signed during the notes that are sung without words at this point. It is an awkward place to stop signing, especially since the choirs mouths will continue to move. [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side + (2h)[H or V] are brought back over the shoulder, POs down, FOs back. 

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>.

<P>TREMBLE - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands vibrate from side to side symmetrically to show legs shaking.

<P>DRIVE-NAIL - [bO] holds nail high in the air and [bX] swings hammer to drive the nail home into the left side and then the right side. 

<P>CROSS - [C], PO away, FO up, traces cross by moving down, then across.

<P>WITHDRAW-SWORD - Mime pulling a sword out of a scabbard. 
 
<P>DRIVE-SWORD-INTO-lf-side - [S] stabs into left side of signer. 

<P>MIME-SWORD-INTO-Jesus-SIDE - Thrust the sword forward as if driving it into Jesus' side.

<P><I>SIDE</I> - Left hand (whether DH or NDH) slides palm down left side. 

<P>SHINE-DOWN - [O^] is held high PO > signer; hands open to [5^] while moving > signer.

<P>PUT-ONTO-SLAB - (2h)[B^] wrap arms around vertical body of Jesus and swing Jesus' body around so that his head is pointing to one side and lay the body down on a stone slab. 

<P>ROLL-STONE-TO-rt - Imagine a large circular stone that rolls on a track in front of a cave (this is the kind used during Jesus' time) and roll it so that it will cover the tomb entrance.
