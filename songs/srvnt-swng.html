<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. What do you want of me, Lord? Where do you want me to serve you? Where can I sing your praises? I am your song. Jesus, Jesus, you are my Lord. Jesus, Jesus, you are the way.

<P>2. I hear you call my name, Lord, and I am moved within me. Your Spirit stirs my deepest self. Sing your songs in me. Jesus, Jesus, you are my Lord. Jesus, Jesus, you are the way. 

<P>3. Above, below, and around me, before, behind, and all through me, your Spirit burns deep within me. Fire my life with your love. Jesus, Jesus, be the warmth of my heart. Jesus, Jesus, you are the way.

<P>4. You are the light in my darkness. You are my strength when I'm weary. You give me sight when I'm blinded. Come see for me. Jesus, Jesus, you are my Light. Jesus, Jesus, you are the way. 

<P>5. I am your song and servant, singing your praise like Mary. Surrendered to your Spirit, "Let it be done to me." Jesus, Jesus, "Let it be done to me." Jesus, Jesus, you are the way.
