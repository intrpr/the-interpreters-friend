<BR>If we learn to live your story, 
<BR>We may die to rise anew. (2)

<BR>Love passed on through act and word; 
<BR>Every person lost and broken 
<BR>Wears the body of our Lord. (2)

<P>4. Gentle Jesus, mighty Spirit,  
<BR>Come inflame our heart anew. 
<BR>We may all your joy inherit, 
<BR>If we bear the cross with you. (2)

<BR>Stumbling though our step may be, 
<BR>One with you in joy and sorrow, 
<BR>We the river, you the sea. (2)
