<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I see trees of green, red roses too.
<BR>I see them bloom for me and you,
<BR>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

<P>I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
<BR>The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
<BR>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

<P>The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
<BR>Are also on the faces of people going by.
<BR>I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"
<BR>They're really saying "I love you."

<P>I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow.
<BR>They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
<BR>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
<BR>Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

<P>Oh yeah!
