<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming from tender stem hath sprung!
<BR>Of Jesse's lineage coming, as those of old have sung.
<BR>It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter,
<BR>When half spent was the night.

<P>2. Isaiah 'twas foretold it, the Rose I have in mind;
<BR>With Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind.
<BR>To show God's love aright, she bore to us a Savior,
<BR>When half spent was the night.

<P>3. The shepherds heard the story proclaimed by angels bright,
<BR>How Christ, the Lord of glory was born on earth this night.
<BR>To Bethlehem they sped and in the manger they found Him,
<BR>As angel heralds said.

<P>4. This Flower, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air,
<BR>Dispels with glorious splendor the darkness everywhere;
<BR>True Man, yet very God, from sin and death He saves us,
<BR>And lightens every load.

<P>5. O Savior, Child of Mary, Who felt our human woe,
<BR>O Savior, King of glory, Who dost our weakness know;
<BR>Bring us at length we pray, to the bright courts of heaven,
<BR>And to the endless day!
