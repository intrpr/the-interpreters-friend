<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>PLANT-SEEDS - [O^], PO down, FO away, moves away while closing to an [A] repeating in rows perpendicular to the chest. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>#BACK-WITH-God - (2h)[B], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held with NDH close to the body and the DH high and close to where God is spatialized. The hands transition to a C and then a K while rushing towards each other and contacting.

<P>ALL-LOOK-AT-me - (2h)[4], POs down, FOs away, turn hands so that the FO is > signer's face.

<P>2. See my face, and see your God, for I will be your hope.

<P>3. Return to me, with all your heart, and I will bring you back.
