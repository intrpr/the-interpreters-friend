<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
<BR>O what a foretaste of glory divine!
<BR>Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
<BR>Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: This is my story, this is my song,
<BR>Praising my Savior, all the day long;
<BR>This is my story, this is my song,
<BR>Praising my Savior, all the day long.

<P>2. Perfect submission, perfect delight,
<BR>Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
<BR>Angels descending bring from above
<BR>Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. 

<P>3. Perfect submission, all is at rest
<BR>I in my Savior am happy and blest,
<BR>Watching and waiting, looking above,
<BR>Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
