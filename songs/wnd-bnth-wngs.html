<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> At the beginning, middle, and end you see some two lines that are in a different font.  This is because I had to preformat these to show the behavior of both hands.  The lower italicized line represents what the NDH (non-dominant hand) is doing.  

<P>ON-TOP - The sign [A] (handshape), PO > NDS (palm orientation towards non-dominant side), thumb pointing up moves upwards in an arc curving away from the body, like part of the sign for "executive" or "higher-ups".  This handshape is held in place while the NDH signs <U>YOU</U> (the honorific you with the [B], PO up points away and descends slightly) FEEL, then the NDH [B], PO down, is held out and the DH [A] turns the thumb down and pushes down the NDH with its tip.

<P>NAME~SHINY - Starts like the sign NAME, the NDH is left in place while the DH touches it with the [open 8] (as in the sign FEEL), then moves upwards while twisting the wrist.  

<P>LET-YOU-KNOW - The one handed sign me-INFORM-you.  

<P>For the middle and last line, which are the same, the [A] of ON-TOP is held in place and the NDH signs WHY?  YOU and then the [B], PO up, moves under the DH which moves down slightly then both of the hands move up like HELP.

<P>STORED-INSIDE-heart - FT of [C] held against the heart while [O^] (as in TEACH) is stuffed several times into the top of the NDH.  

<P>(2h)alt.OVERLOOK - The hands alternately sign OVERLOOK, where the [B] passes diagonally across the face. 

<P>The words inside the symbols "||:" and ":||" are repeated as used in musical notation.

<P>On a lighter note, I heard that one interpreter spread out one arm and fanned her underarm to show "You are the wind beneath my wings."  Tee hee, gag. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>It must have been cold there in my shadow, 
<BR>to never have sunlight on your face. 
<BR>You were content to let me shine, that's your way, 
<BR>you always walked a step behind. 

<P>So I was the one with all the glory, 
<BR>while you were the one with all the strength. 
<BR>A beautiful face without a name -- for so long, 
<BR>a beautiful smile to hide the pain. 

<P><U>Chorus:</U> Did you ever know that you're my hero, 
<BR>and ev'rything I would like to be? 
<BR>I can fly higher than an eagle, 
<BR>'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. 

<P>It might have appeared to go unnoticed, 
<BR>but I've got it all here in my heart. 
<BR>I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it, 
<BR>I would be nothing with out you. 

<P><U>Chorus:</U>

<P>Fly, fly, fly away, 
<BR>you let me fly so high. 
<BR>Oh, fly, fly, 
<BR>so high against the sky, so high I almost touch the sky. 
<BR>Thank you, thank you, thank God for you, 
<BR>the wind beneath my wings.
