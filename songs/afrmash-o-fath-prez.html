<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM
<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>WE BELIEVE GOD WILL FORGIVE OUR SIN IF WE BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST. WHY?  KNOW-THAT EVERYTHING LEAD-TO GOOD FOR <U>THOSE</U>-rt LOVE GOD. GOD CALLS <U>THEM</U>-rt DO HIS-rt PURPOSE. TRUTH CONVINCE US THAT NOT DEATH, NOT LIFE, NOT ANGEL, NOT RULER, NOTHING NOW AND NOTHING FUTURE, NO POWER, NO HIGH PLACE, NO DEEP PLACE, NOTHING IN UNIVERSE ABLE SEPARATE US FROM LOVE GOD IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=67">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Sin.</A> 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P><U>THOSE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>PURPOSE - THINK MEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/purpose.swf">ASL Pro: Purpose.</A>

<P>RULER - CONTROL AGENT.

<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B> We believe there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus; for we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to God's purpose. We are convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
