<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>1. INSIDE BUD, WE FIND FLOWER. INSIDE SEED, FUTURE TREE.
<BR>BUTTERFLY WRAPPED-UP HIDE INSIDE, WAIT SOON FREE FLY-AWAY.
<BR>DURING WINTER SNOW REMEMBER, SPRING WILL SOON ARRIVE.
<BR>SOME THINGS WE OVERLOOK, UNTIL GOD SHOW US HIS-rt TRUTH.

<P>2. EVERY SILENCE, SONG MAYBE HIDE, SEARCH-FOR WORDS EXPRESS ITSELF.
<BR>EVERY DARK NIGHT LEAD-TO DAWN, BRING HOPE FOR (2h)<U>YOU</U> AND <U>ME</U>.
<BR>PAST MAYBE SAD BUT FUTURE BETTER, BUT WE NOT KNOW FOR SURE.
<BR>SOME THINGS WE OVERLOOK, UNTIL GOD SHOW US HIS-rt TRUTH.

<P>3. LIFE SEEM END, BUT CAN CONTINUE. JESUS BRING LIFE NEW. 
<BR>SOMETIMES DOUBT LEAD-TO BELIEF, LIVE FOREVER CAN.
<BR>AFTER DEATH, WE RESURRECT, PAH CONQUER DEATH.
<BR>SOME THINGS WE OVERLOOK, UNTIL GOD SHOW US HIS-rt TRUTH.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BUD - (2h)[5^], FOs up, are held close together.

<P>SEED - [O^], PO down, FO away, moves away while closing to an [A], as if planting seeds.

<P>WRAPPED-UP - (2h)[O^], DH circles FT of NDH.

<P>FLY-AWAY - The sign BUTTERFLY moves away.

<P>(2h)<U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>RESURRECT - [V], PO up, FO away, pronates and hops onto the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_resurrection.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Resurrection.</A>

<P>PAH! - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>.  

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. In the bulb there is a flower; in the seed, an apple tree;
<BR>In cocoons, a hidden promise: butterflies will soon be free!
<BR>In the cold and snow of winter there’s a spring that waits to be,
<BR>Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.

<P>2. There’s a song in every silence, seeking word and melody;
<BR>There’s a dawn in every darkness, bringing hope to you and me.
<BR>From the past will come the future; what it holds, a mystery,
<BR>Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.

<P>3. In our end is our beginning; in our time, infinity;
<BR>In our doubt there is believing; in our life, eternity,
<BR>In our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory,
<BR>Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.
