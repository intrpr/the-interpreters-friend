<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. God of all the hungry millions. God who suffers with the poor. 
<BR>Still our greed keeps us from sharing with the hungry at our door. 
<BR>All who thirst will thirst no longer, when we do as you would do. 
<BR>May we care for all your people. Help us know that they are you.

<P>2. God who travels with the stranger, greeted by our apathy, 
<BR>teach us to embrace all people. All can live with dignity. 
<BR>You have bid us clothe the naked, bringing hope in all we do. 
<BR>May we welcome all your people. Help us know that they are you.

<P>3. God who loves the sick, the dying, they are precious in you sight. 
<BR>We will bring them your compassion, fill their living with your light. 
<BR>God who brings the captive freedom, free our hearts to love anew. 
<BR>May we comfort all your people. Help us know that they are you.
