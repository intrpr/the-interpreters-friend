<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When I survey the wondrous cross 
<BR>On which the prince of glory died,
<BR>My richest gain I count but loss 
<BR>And pour contempt on all my pride.

<P>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast 
<BR>Save in the death of Christ, my God;
<BR>All the vain things that charm me most,
<BR>I sacrifice them to his blood.

<P>See, from his head, his hands, his feet
<BR>Sorrow and love flow mingled down,
<BR>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
<BR>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

<P>Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
<BR>That were a tribute far too small;
<BR>Love so amazing, so divine,
<BR>Demands my soul, my life, my all!
