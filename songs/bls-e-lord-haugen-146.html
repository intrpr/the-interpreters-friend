<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]".

<P><U>HE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>COMFORT - Like COMFORTABLE but signed more slowly.

<P>SCADS-OF - (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, move forward to show many beings. 

<P>BRIGHT - (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A> 

<P>DON'T - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>RULER - CONTROL AGENT. 

<P>MIGHTY - (2h)[S], POs > back of signer, FOs up, are held at NDS and fists descend, then repeat at DS. 

<P>BREATHING - (2h)[5], POs > signer, FOs >&lt;, hands move to and for as if breathing. 

<P>GONE - [5^], PO > face, FO up, moves downwards and closes to a [O^], while the NDH is a [B], PO > singer, FO > DS held further away and in neutral space.

<P>LOWLY - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs up, move downwards arcing towards the signer. This is the opposite of the sign ADVANCED. For an animated gif of ADVANCED, see <A HREF="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=23">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Exalted.</A>

<P>RAISE-UP - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs away, lower slightly, supinate, and rise up.

<P>FEEL-DEFLATED - [C], PO > NDS, FO up, is held at midchest and closes to [O^]. You can hold [B], PO down, FO > DS underneath it.

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L].

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P><B>Refrain</B>: O bless the Lord, my soul who heals the broken-hearted.

<P>1. For all my life I will sing to you, O ever faithful God. You fill the heavens with wondrous lights. The earth sings out your glory.

<P>2. Put not your trust in those who rule, the mighty of this earth. Their breath shall fail, their power die, their plans shall fade and vanish. 

<P>3. You give your sight to all the blind; you raise up those bent low. Your heart is near to the broken ones; you welcome in the stranger.

<P>4. Happy those who keep faith with you, securing justice for the oppressed, who give your food to each hungry heart, your freedom to each captive.

<P>5. The weak and poor you sustain in love, the wicked ones you bring to destruction; Forevermore shall your reign endure, to every generation.
