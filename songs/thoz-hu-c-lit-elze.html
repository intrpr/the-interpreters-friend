<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Those who see light can walk in the dark. 
<BR>Those who see love can see God. 
<BR>Those who look up will discover God's face, 
<BR>those who look down will uncover God's path, 
<BR>those who perceive God is here with us now
<BR>will see God's return.

<P>2. Those who see light can walk in the dark. 
<BR>Those who see love can see God.
<BR>Those who have witnessed the sunrise and set, 
<BR>those who have studied a flower unfold, 
<BR>those who have focused on land, sea, and sky 
<BR>have seen Jesus Christ.

<P>3. Those who see light can walk in the dark. 
<BR>Those who see love can see God.
<BR>Those who see good in each person they meet,
<BR>those who look after their neighbors in need,
<BR>those who believe God's now living in them  
<BR>will see God's return.
