<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Will you let me be your servant, 
<BR>let me be as Christ to you?
<BR>Pray that I might have the grace 
<BR>to let you be my servant, too.

<P>2. We are pilgrims on a journey, 
<BR>we are trav’lers on the road.
<BR>We are here to help each other 
<BR>walk the mile and bear the load.

<P>3. I will hold the Christ-light for you 
<BR>in the night time of your fear.
<BR>I will hold my hand out to you, 
<BR>speak the peace you long to hear.

<P>4. I will weep when you are weeping, 
<BR>when you laugh I'll laugh with you.
<BR>I will share your joy and sorrow 
<BR>till we've seen this journey through.

<P>5. When we sing to God in heaven, 
<BR>we shall find such harmony,
<BR>born of all we've known together 
<BR>of Christ's love and agony.

<P>6. Will you let me be your servant, 
<BR>let me be as Christ to you?
<BR>Pray that I might have the grace 
<BR>to let you be my servant, too.
