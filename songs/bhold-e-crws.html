<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1, 5. Behold the cross on which was hung life's very Lord, God's only Son; Mary's own babe, so cold and so still, helpless before her on Calvary hill.

<P>2. Nails in his hands, nails in his feet, a traitor kiss upon his cheek; and his pierced heart, now broken in two, love crucified for me and for you. 

<P>3. Eyes that won't see, ears that won't hear, lips that deny the friend once so dear; slowly he turns and captures your eye, then passes on to Calvary to die.

<P>4. Behold the cross of Christ in our midst: all those who bear his wounds in their flesh. Suffering for crimes of mercy and peace, signs of the kingdom on Calvary street.
