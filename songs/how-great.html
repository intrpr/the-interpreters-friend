<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder
<BR>Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
<BR>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
<BR>Thy power throughout the universe displayed:

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
<BR>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
<BR>Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
<BR>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

<P>2. When through the woods and forest glades I wander
<BR>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
<BR>When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
<BR>And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

<P>3. And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
<BR>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
<BR>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
<BR>He bled and died to take away my sin. 

<P>4. When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
<BR>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
<BR>Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
<BR>And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
