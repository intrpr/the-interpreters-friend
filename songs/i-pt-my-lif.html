<P><B>Refrain:</B> Father, Father, I put my life in your hands.

<P>1. In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. In your justice rescue me, oh my faithful Lord, in your hands I comment my spirit.

<P>2. For all my foes reproach me; all my friends are now put to flight. I am forgotten like the unremembered dead, like a dish that now is broken.

<P>3. I place my trust in you, Lord; in your hands is my destiny. Let your face shine upon your servant, Lord, in your hands I will place my life.
