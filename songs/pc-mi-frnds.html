<P><B>Refrain:</B> Peace I leave with you, my friends, 
<BR>Shalom, my peace, in all you do. 
<BR>Peace I leave with you, my friends. 
<BR>I give to you so you can give to others, too.

<BR>to show his kindness to all men. 
<BR>Go now, my friends, and do the same, 
<BR>until I come again.

<P>2. Take my hand and be at peace; 
<BR>The Spirit of our love I send. 
<BR>And with this love you will be free, 
<BR>until I come again.

<P>3. With this love all men will know
<BR>that loneliness is at an end.
<BR>Rejoice, my brothers, though I go, 
<BR>for I will come again.
