<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Faith of our fathers, living still,
<BR>In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
<BR>O how our hearts beat high with joy
<BR>Whenever we hear that glorious Word!

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
<BR>We will be true to thee till death.

<P>2. Faith of our fathers, we will strive
<BR>To win all nations unto Thee;
<BR>And through the truth that comes from God,
<BR>We all shall then be truly free.

<P>3. Faith of our fathers, we will love
<BR>Both friend and foe in all our strife;
<BR>And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
<BR>By kindly words and virtuous life.
