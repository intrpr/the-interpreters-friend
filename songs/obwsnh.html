<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> (SING LANGUAGE FROM AFRICA.) - This is simply to inform the Deaf audience of what is happening and perhaps why they can't lipread  parts of the song.

<P>Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>THANKFUL - THANK++.

<P>GATHER-UP - [5:], PO down, FO away, scrapes material into palm of upturned [B] while sweeping > NDS. 

<P>"HEY"-all - Looks like (2h)CHILDREN but the movement is larger and is basically waving to get attention of everyone.

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>GHANA - [G], PO > signer, moves from FTs to end of palm of [B], PO up, FO away from signer, 2x.

<P>WANNA - (2h)[5:], POs up, FOs away, wg fingers but hands remain in place. 

<P>GROUP-GO - (2h)[C], POs >&lt;, FT touch, and both hands move together > appropriate space. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>(NOW SING LANGUAGE FROM AFRICA. TAKE-IT-AWAY.) - When the chorus goes into this extended repetition of their language (sorry I don't know which specific language from Ghana it is) you could turn the attention to them and stop until they return to English. TAKE-IT-AWAY is [B], PO down, FO > NDS, flips over and points > choir.
