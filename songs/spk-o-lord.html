<P><B>Refrain:</B> ALLELUIA-lf! ALLELUIA-rt! ALLELUIA-ctr!  

<P>A. GO-AHEAD INFORM"all", LORD. YOUR-lf WORDS OFFER LIFE FOREVER.

<P>B. LORD ANNOUNCE, (role play from lf) <U>ME</U> LIGHT FOR WORLD. ANYONE FOLLOW <U>ME</U> HAVE LIGHT FOR LIFE.

<P>C. WE BOW-DOWN-TO <U>YOU</U>-lf, LORD CREATOR. WHY? IF PEOPLE HUMBLE, WEAK, <U>YOU</U> EXPLAIN YOUR KINGDOM.

<P>D. GOD HIS-rt WORD BECOME HUMAN, <U>HE</U>-lf COME LIVE WITH US. FOR-FOR? ANYONE BELIEVE, <U>THEY</U>-rt BECOME GOD HIS-rt CHILDREN CAN.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B>

<P>ALLELUIA!-lf ALLELUIA!-rt ALLELUIA!-ctr - Twist > lf and sign Alleluia! (CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting), twist > rt and sign Alleluia!, finally come back to center and sign Alleluia!

<P>GO-AHEAD - (2h)[B^ dot], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move forward in a jerk. 

<P><U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A> 

<P>ANYONE - [A dot], PO > NDS, FO up, twists rapidly at the wrist while moving in a horizontal circle. This means "anyone".  

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]". 

<P>CREATOR - MAKER.

<P>KINGDOM - KING + [5], PO down, FO away, circles horizontally. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_kingdom.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Kingdom.</A>
<P>HUMAN - H-BODY.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B>  Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

<P>A. Speak, O Lord, your servant is listening. You have the words of everylasting life.

<P>B. "I am the Light of the world," says the Lord. "All who follow me shall have the light of life.

<P>C. Blessed are you, O Lord of creation, revealing your kingdom to the humble and weak.

<P>D. The Word of God came and lived here among us, so all who believe might be the children of God.
