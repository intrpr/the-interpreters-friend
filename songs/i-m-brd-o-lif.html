<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored. 

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards.

<P>HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH - held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/heavenlyfather_a.swf">ASL Pro: Heavenly Father - 1.</A>  

<P>PULL-rt - Pull on imaginary rope to your right.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.    

<P>RAISE~(2h)<U>HIM</U>-rt~UP-TO-Heaven - (2h)[B], POs down, FOs > rt, lower slightly, supinate, and rise slightly + hands descend slighty to show the honorific index + hands are then fully lifted up to Heaven.

<P>FLESH - Pinch cheek and pull it slightly side to side.

<P>SECOND A-D-A-M - The concept is from the Hebrew "ben Adam" meaning the son of Adam. Adam can mean "man" but SON FROM MAN does not convey the concept that "[for] as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive."

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice. 

<P>RESURRECTION - [V], PO up, FO away, pronates and hops onto the palm of [B], PO up, FO away. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.valleybible.net/DeafMinistry/ASL_Dictionary/asl_resurrection.php">Valley Bible Church - ASL dictionary: Resurrection.</A>

<P>SELF-ON-INDEX - [A], PO > signer, FO away, taps against [1], PO > DS, FO up.

<P>MESSAGE - (2h)[F] interlink slightly as they separate and close twice. 

<P>PAH - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>.  

<P>(2h)THIS - (2h)[1^], POs down, FOs away, hands descend slightly.
