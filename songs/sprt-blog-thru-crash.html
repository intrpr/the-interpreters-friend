<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Spirit blowing through creation,
<BR>Spirit burning in the skies,
<BR>Let the hope of your salvation fill our eyes;
<BR>God of Splendor, God of glory,
<BR>You who light the stars above,
<BR>All the heavens tell the story or your love.
 
<P><B>Refrain:</B> Spirit renewing the earth, 
<BR>Renewing the hearts of all people;
<BR>Burn in the weary souls, 
<BR>Blow through the silent lips,
<BR>Come now awake us! Spirit of God.

<P>2. As You moved upon the waters,
<BR>As You ride upon the wind,
<BR>Move us all, Your sons and daughters deep within.
<BR>As You shaped the hills and mountains,
<BR>Formed the land and filled the deep,
<BR>Let Your hand renew and waken all who sleep.

<P>3. Love that sends the rivers dancing,
<BR>Love that waters all that lives,
<BR>Love that heals and holds and rouses and forgives,
<BR>You are food for all Your creatures,
<BR>You are hunger in the soul,
<BR>In Your hands the broken-hearted are made whole.

<P>4. All the creatures You have fashioned,
<BR>All that live and breathe in You,
<BR>Find their hope in Your compassion, strong and true,
<BR>You, O Spirit of salvation,
<BR>You alone, beneath, above,
<BR>Come renew Your whole creation in Your love.
