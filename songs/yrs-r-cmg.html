<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Years are coming, speed them onward 
<BR>When the sword shall gather rust,
<BR>And the helmet, lance, and falchion 
<BR>Sleep at last in silent dust.
<BR>Earth has heard too long of battle, 
<BR>Heard the trumpet's voice too long.
<BR>But another age advances, 
<BR>Seers foretold in ancient song.

<P>Years are coming when forever 
<BR>War's dread banner shall be furled,
<BR>And the angel Peace be welcomed, 
<BR>Regent of a happy world,
<BR>Hail with song that glorious era, 
<BR>When the sword shall gather rust,
<BR>And the helmet, lance and falchion 
<BR>Sleep at last in silent dust.
