<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Antiphon:</B> Yahweh's love will last forever, 
<BR>his faithfulness till the end of time. 
<BR>Yahweh is a loving God. 
<BR>Yahweh, the faithful one.

<P>1. Have no fear, for I am with you;
<BR>I will be your shield.
<BR>Go now and leave your homeland,
<BR>for I will give you a home.

<P>2. You shall be my chosen people, 
<BR>and I will be your God.
<BR>I will bless your name forever 
<BR>and keep you from all harm.

<P>3. Look up and see the heavens
<BR>and count the stars if you can.
<BR>Your name will be even greater,
<BR>greater than all these stars.

<P>4. See now the land before you, 
<BR>rich with food and rain.
<BR>No longer must you wander,
<BR>for this will be your home.
