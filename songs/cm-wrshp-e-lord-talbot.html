<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Come, and worship the Lord, for we are his people the flock that he shepherds. Alleluia.

<P>1. Come, let us sing to the Lord, and shout with joy to the rock that saves us. Let us come with thanksgiving, and sing joyful songs to the Lord.

<P>2. Come, let us bow down and worship, bending the knee before the Lord our maker, for we are his people; we are the flock he shepherds.

<P>3. The Lord is God, the mighty God, the great king o'er all other gods. He holds in his hands the depths of the earth and the highest mountains as well. He made the sea; it belongs now to him. The dry land, too, was formed by his hand.
