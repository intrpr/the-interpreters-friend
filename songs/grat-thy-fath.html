<P>1. Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;

<BR>As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Great is Thy faithfulness!
<BR>Great is Thy faithfulness!
<BR>Morning by morning new mercies I see.
<BR>All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;
<BR>Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

<P>2. Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
<BR>Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
<BR>Join with all nature in manifold witness
<BR>To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
<BR>Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
