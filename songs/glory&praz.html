<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Glory and praise to our God, who alone gives light to our days. Many are the blessing
he bears to those who trust in his ways.

<P>1. We, the daughters and sons of him who built the valleys and plains, praise the wonders our God has done in every heart that sings. 

<P>2. In his wisdom he strengthens us, like gold that's tested in fire. Though the power of sin prevails, our God is there to save.

<P>3.  Every moment of every day, our God is waiting to save, always ready to seek the lost, to answer those who pray.

<P>4. God has watered our barren land and spent his merciful rain. Now the rivers of life run full for anyone to drink.
