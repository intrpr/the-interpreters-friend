<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>BOW-DOWN-TO - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. Note: This may seem a strange translation of "bless", but theologically I don't see how we can bless God. The Hebrew this concept comes from is "baruch" and is related to "birkayim (knees)", in other words "bend the knee [to God]".

<P><U>HIM</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>CAUSE - (2h)[S] are held at the chest as if holding a rope and move forward while opening to (2h)[5]. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/C/W0575.htm">ASL browser - cause</A>. 

<P>(2h)#ALL - (2h)[A], POs >&lt;, FOs up, are held at shoulder height and move away while opening to (2h)[L]. 

<P>RULE - CONTROL.

<P>INSIDE-SELF - The FT of [C] are held against the chest and stuff the FT of [O^] into the [C] twice.  

<P>SUMMON - DH [B] taps NDH [B], PO down, FO > signer, then moves > signer while closing to an [A], PO away from signer, FO up, and moving up. 

<P>ALLELUIA! - CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>GIFT-TO-us - (2h)[X], POs >&lt;, FOs up, nod downwards at wrist > signer to show that something is given as a gift. 

<P>LIGHT - Same sign as BRIGHT and CLEAR, that is, (2h)[O^], POs away, FOs up, open to (2h)[5], while separating. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/l/light_a.swf">ASL Pro: Light - 1.</A>

<P>SHINE-DOWN - [O^] is held high PO > signer; hands open to [5^] while moving > signer.

<P>KIND - (2h)[B^], POs >&lt;, FOs away, NDH is held close to heart and DH circles around it.
