<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>The Lord of the Universe who reigned
<BR>before anything was created.
<BR>When all was made by his will
<BR>He was acknowledged as King.

<P>And when all shall end 
<BR>He still all alone shall reign.
<BR>He was, He is, 
<BR>and He shall be in glory.

<P>And He is one, and there's no other,
<BR>to compare or join Him. 
<BR>Without beginning, without end
<BR>and to Him belongs dominion and power. 

<P>And He is my G-d, my living G-d. 
<BR>to Him I flee in time of grief,
<BR>and He is my miracle and my refuge,
<BR>who answers the day I shall call. 

<P>To Him I commit my spirit,
<BR>in the time of sleep and awakening,
<BR>even if my spirit leaves,
<BR>G-d is with me, I shall not fear.
