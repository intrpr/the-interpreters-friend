<P>BELL-TOLLS - [O^], PO down, FO away, strikes NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away, and then shakes as it travels > DS.

<P>BOTH VERSE SIMULTANEOUS - This is actually signed to inform the Deaf people that the first two parts are being sung simulaneously. Partly to show the complexity of what's happening, and partly in case they have some hearing and all of a sudden what they hear sounds cacophanous.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Part 1: Snowflakes falling all over town, slipping, sliding, everybody rushin' 'round. There's an icy chill in the air, telling us that winter's really here. Oh! I'm so glad that winter is here. Grab your sled and let out a happy cheer because it's snowing, blowing, all through the day. Winter winds will surely blow all your cares away. 

<P>Part 2: Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh. 
<BR>O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way. 
<BR>Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright. 
<BR>What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight. Oh! 
<BR>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 
<BR>Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. 

<P>Part 3: Sing Parts 1 & 2 simultaneously.
