<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated.

<P>(2h)JOY - Same sign as (2h)HAPPY but mouth "joy". 

<P>(second time sign and shift shoulder) - this song has echo passages where a portion of the refrain is repeated by the choir but <I>sotto voce</I> (in a subdued voice) and not with the full choir. To mirror this effect you can turn to one side the second time and use a small signing space.
