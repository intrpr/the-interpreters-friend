<P>Loving God, you called us each by name and gave your only Son to redeem us. In your faithfulness, you sent the Holy Spirit to complete the mission of Jesus among us.

<P>Open our hearts to Jesus. Give us the courage to speak his name to those who are close to us and the generosity to share his love with those far away.

<P>We pray that every person throughout the world be invited to know and love Jesus as Savior and Redeemer. May they come to know his all-surpassing love. May that love transform every element of our society.

<P>We ask this through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.

<P>Mary, Mother of the Church, pray for us.

<P>St. Paul the Apostle, pray for us.
