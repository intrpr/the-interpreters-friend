<P>Spring is here
<BR>To cheer the heart.
<BR>Time to fall in love
<BR>And put on a merry face.

<P>The newly fresh air
<BR>Calls us to cheer and merrymaking
<BR>In this changing time.
<BR>Everything is quite lovely.

<P>The greenery is new and fresh,
<BR>And flowers cover the meadow
<BR>And the trees are adorned with blossoms
<BR>In the same way.
