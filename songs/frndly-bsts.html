<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. Jesus our brother, strong (some versions have "kind") and good
<BR>Was humbly born in a stable rude
<BR>And the friendly beasts around Him stood,
<BR>Jesus our brother, strong and good.

<P>2. "I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown,
<BR>"I carried His mother up hill and down;
<BR>I carried her safely to Bethlehem town."
<BR>"I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown.

<P>3. "I," said the cow all white and red
<BR>"I gave Him my manger for His bed;
<BR>I gave him my hay to pillow his head."
<BR>"I," said the cow all white and red. 	

<P>4. "I," said the sheep with curly horn,
<BR>"I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm;
<BR>He wore my coat on Christmas morn."
<BR>"I," said the sheep with curly horn.

<P>5. "I," said the dove from the rafters high,
<BR>"I cooed Him to sleep so He would not cry;
<BR>We cooed him to sleep, my mate and I."
<BR>"I," said the dove from the rafters high.

<P>6. Thus every beast by some good spell,
<BR>In the stable dark was glad to tell
<BR>Of the gift he gave Immanuel,
<BR>The gift he gave Immanuel.

<P>7. "I," was glad to tell
<BR>Of the gift he gave Immanuel,
<BR>The gift he gave Immanuel.
<BR>Jesus our brother, strong and good.
