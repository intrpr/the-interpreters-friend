<P>We are gathered here at this time to witness and to celebrate the coming together of two separate lives.  We have come to witness the joining of (name of groom) and (name of bride) in marriage; to be with them and rejoice with them in the making of this important and everlasting commitment.  It is a decision not to be entered into lightly, but rather undertaken with great consideration and respect for both the other person and oneself.

<P>WE GATHER-TOGETHER<a href="mrj-crmony.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> HERE TODAY FOR-FOR?  (&lt;) WITNESS, (>) CELEBRATE, TWO SEPARATE LIVE MERGE.  WE COME FOR-FOR?

DECIDE MARRY NOTHING-TO-IT?  #NO.  BEFORE-THAT THINK-ABOUT CAREFUL MUST.  RESPECT-lf, RESPECT-rt. 

<P>Marriage symbolizes the ultimate sharing of two lives.  It must not diminish, but rather should enhance the individuality of each partner.  We give ourselves in love, but we do not give ourselves away.  A good and balanced relationship is one in which neither person is overpowered or absorbed by the other.

<P>Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it down not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, self-seeking or easily angered.  Love keeps nor record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails.

<P>LOVE MEAN PATIENT.  LOVE MEAN KIND.  NOT JEALOUS, NOT BRAG, NOT BIG-HEADED.  NOT RUDE, NOT alt.ME, NOT EASY BLOW-STACK.  NOT alt.WRONG, FINE, MAKE-LIST.  LOVE, NOT THRILLED BAD HAPPEN, BUT CELEBRATE TRUTH CONQUER LIE.  LOVE, ALWAYS PROTECT, ALWAYS TRUST, ALWAYS HOPE, ALWAYS STUBBORN*.  FAIL, NEVER.
