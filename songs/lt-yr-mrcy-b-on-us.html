<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Let your mercy be on us, O God, as we place our trust in you.

<P>1. Your words, O God, are truth indeed, and all your works are ever faithful; You love justice and right, your compassion fills all creation.

<P>2. See how the eye of God is watching, ever guarding all who wait in hope to deliver them from death and sustain them in time of famine.

<P>3. Exult, you just, and rejoice! for praise is the song of the righteous! How happy your people, O God, the one whom you have chosen.

<P>4. Our soul is waiting for God, for God is our help and our shield; May your kindness and love be on us who place our hope in you.
