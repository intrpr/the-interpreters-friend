<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
<BR>In a believer's ear!
<BR>It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
<BR>And drives away his fear.

<P>2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
<BR>And calms the troubled breast;
<BR>'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
<BR>And to the weary, rest.

<P>3. Dear Name, the Rock on which I build,
<BR>My Shield and Hiding Place,
<BR>My never failing treasury, filled
<BR>With boundless stores of grace!

<P>4. By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,
<BR>Although with sin defiled;
<BR>Satan accuses me in vain,
<BR>And I am owned a child.

<P>5. Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,
<BR>O Prophet, Priest and King,
<BR>My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
<BR>Accept the praise I bring.

<P>6. Weak is the effort of my heart,
<BR>And cold my warmest thought;
<BR>But when I see Thee as Thou art,
<BR>I'll praise Thee as I ought.

<P>7. Till then I would Thy love proclaim
<BR>With every fleeting breath,
<BR>And may the music of Thy Name
<BR>Refresh my soul in death!
