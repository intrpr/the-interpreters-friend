<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. There is a Flower sprung of a tree,
<BR>The root thee of is called Jesse;
<BR>A flower of price, 
<BR>There is none such in Paradise!

<P>2. This Flower is fair and fresh of hue:
<BR>It fadeth never, but ever is new;
<BR>The blissful branch this Flower on grew
<BR>Was Mary mild that bare Jesu.
<BR>A flower of grace,
<BR>Against all sorrow it is solace!

<P>3. The seed hereof was God's command,
<BR>That God Himself sowed with His hand
<BR>In Bethlehem, in that holy land;
<BR>Amidst her harbour there he [the Angel] her found.
<BR>This blissful Flower
<BR>Sprang never but in Mary's bower.

<P>4. When Gabriel this maiden met,
<BR>With "Ave Maria" he her gret [he greeted her];
<BR>Between them two this Flower was set,
<BR>And kept (it) was, no man shall wit;
<BR>But on a day
<BR>In Bethlehem It gan spread and spray.

<P>5. When that Flower began to spread,
<BR>And His blossom forth He led,
<BR>Rich and poor in every stead,
<BR>They marvelled how this Flower might spread,
<BR>And kinges three
<BR>That blissful Flower came to see.

<P>6. Angels there came out of their tower
<BR>To look upon this freshly Flower,
<BR>How fair He was in His colour,
<BR>And how sweet in His savour,
<BR>And to behold
<BR>How such a Flower might spring in gold!

<P>7. Of lily, of rose of ryse [branch],
<BR>Of primrose, and of fleur-de-lys,
<BR>Of all the flowers at my device,
<BR>That Flower of Jesse yet bears the price
<BR>As most of heal,
<BR>To slake our sorrows every deal.

<P>8. I pray thee, flowers of this countree,
<BR>Wherever ye go, wherever ye be,
<BR>Hold up the Flower of good Jesse,
<BR>For your freshness and your beauty,
<BR>As fairest of all,
<BR>And ever was and ever shall.
