<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When in our music God is glorified,
<BR>And adoration leaves no room for pride,
<BR>It is as though the whole creation cried
<BR>Alleluia!

<P>How often, making music, we have found
<BR>A new dimension in the world of sound,
<BR>As worship moved us to a more profound
<BR>Alleluia!

<P>So has the Church, in liturgy and song, 
<BR>In faith and love, through centuries of wrong, 
<BR>Borne witness to the truth in every tongue 
<BR>Alleluia!

<P>Let every instrument be tuned for praise!
<BR>Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise!
<BR>And may God give us faith to sing always
<BR>Alleluia!
