<P>ME WAKE-UP NOW MORNING, MY MIND PERSEVERATE FREE. ALLELU, ALLELU, ALLEUIA. YOU MUST WALK+, YOUR MIND PERSEVERATE FREE. YOU MUST TALK+, YOUR MIND PERSEVERATE FREE.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> This song has a lot of repetition, so you will need to find out just how the choir will handle it and if there will be congregational response.

<P>PERSEVERATE - [open 8] touches top of [B], PO down, FO away, and both hands together circle vertically at a right angle to the chest. 

<P>ALLELU - CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE.

<P>ALLEUIA -  CLAP-HANDS~CELEBRATE + open hands into (2h)[5] while lifting.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I woke up this morning with my mind staying on freedom. Allelu, allelu, alleluia! You gotta walk with your mind staying on freedom. You gotta talk with your mind staying on freedom.
