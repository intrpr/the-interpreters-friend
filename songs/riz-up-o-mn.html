<BR>Have done with lesser things. 
<BR>Give heart and soul and mind and strength
<BR>To serve the King of Kings.

<P>2. Rise up, O men of God,
<BR>In one united throng.
<BR>[or His kingdom tarries long:]
<BR>Bring in the day of brotherhood
<BR>And end the night of wrong.

<P>3. Rise up, O men of God!
<BR>The church for you doth wait, 
<BR>Her strength unequal to her task;
<BR>Rise up, and make her great!

<P>4. Rise up, O men of God!
<BR>[or Lift high the cross of Christ!]
<BR>Tread where his feet have trod.
<BR>As brothers of the Son of Man,
<BR>Rise up, O men of God!
