<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BIRD'bob head & move beak' - BIRD is performed multiple times while the head moves from side to side while circling in a figure eight like Stevie Wonder.

<P>BLOSSOM - (2h)[A] are held together but the hands are twisted like the beginning of CHANGE.  Hands twist back while opening to (2h)[5:] with the hands still held together.         

<P>SCADS-OF - (2h)[5:], POs down, FOs away, move forward to show many beings.

<P>MALE-FLIRT - (2h)[5:], POs down are held with thumbs touching and hands rotate in opposite directions while maintaining contact at thumbs.

<P>FEMALE-FLIRT - (2h)[5], POs down are held with thumbs touching and FT wiggle. 

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity.

<P>PAWS-AT-GROUND - (2h)[S], FOs down, are held like feet and DH nods and moves backwards multiple times as if pawing at the ground.

<P>BUCK - (2h)[4], POs >&lt;, FOs up, shoot upwards.

<P>4-LEG-JUMP - (2h)[V] are held like the fourlegs of an animal and both hands rise and curl the FTs as if the animal were leaping.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Spring has come in
<BR>Loudly sing, cuckoo!
<BR>Grows the seed and blooms the meadow
<BR>And the woods springs now
<BR>Sing, cuckoo!

<P>The ewe bleats after the lamb
<BR>The calf lows after the cow
<BR>The bull leaps, the buck leaps, twisting.
<BR>Merrily sing, cuckoo!
<BR>Cuckoo, cuckoo,

<P>Well sing you, cuckoo.
<BR>Nor cease you ever now!
<BR>Sing cuckoo now, sing cuckoo!
<BR>Sing cuckoo now, sing cuckoo!
