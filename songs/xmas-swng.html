<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire; 
<BR>Jack Frost nipping at your nose; 
<BR>Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, 
<BR>And folks dressed up like Eskimos. 

<P>Everybody knows a turkey and some 
<BR>Mistletoe help to make the season bright. 
<BR>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
<BR>Will find it hard to sleep tonight. 

<P>They know that Santa's on his way. 
<BR>He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh, 
<BR>And ev'ry mother's Child is gonna spy to see if 
<BR>Reindeer really know how to fly. 

<P>And so, I'm offering this 
<BR>Simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two.
<BR>Altho' it's been said many times, 
<BR>Many ways: "Merry Christmas to you!"
