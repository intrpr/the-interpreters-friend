<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> (Some versions sing 1, 2, 4, 3, and 7, omitting 5 & 6)

<P>1. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
<BR>That saved a wretch like me!
<BR>I once was lost, but now am found;
<BR>Was blind, but now I see.

<P>2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
<BR>And grace my fears relieved;
<BR>How precious did that grace appear
<BR>The hour I first believed.

<P>3. Through many dangers, toils and snares,
<BR>I have already come;
<BR>'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
<BR>And grace will lead me home.

<P>4. The Lord has promised good to me,
<BR>His Word my hope secures;
<BR>He will my Shield and Portion be,
<BR>As long as life endures.

<P>5. Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
<BR>And mortal life shall cease,
<BR>I shall possess, within the veil,
<BR>A life of joy and peace.

<P>6. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
<BR>The sun forbear to shine;
<BR>But God, Who called me here below,
<BR>Shall be forever mine.

<P>7. When we've been there ten thousand years,
<BR>Bright shining as the sun,
<BR>We've no less days to sing God's praise
<BR>Than when we'd first begun.
