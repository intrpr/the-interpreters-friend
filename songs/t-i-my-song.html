<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. This is my song, Oh God of all the nations,
<BR>A song of peace for lands afar and mine.
<BR>This is my home, the country where my heart is;
<BR>Here are my hopes, my dreams, my sacred shrine.
<BR>But other hearts in other lands are beating,
<BR>With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.

<P>2. My country's skies are bluer than the ocean,
<BR>And sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine.
<BR>But other lands have sunlight too and clover,
<BR>And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.
<BR>Oh hear my song, oh God of all the nations,
<BR>A song of peace for their land and for mine.

<P>3. May truth and freedom come to every nation
<BR>May peace abound where strife has raged so long;
<BR>That each may seek to love and build together,
<BR>A world united, righting every wrong.
<BR>A world united in its love for freedom,
<BR>Proclaiming peace together in one song.
