<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
<BR>announces that the Lord is nigh;
<BR>awake and hearken, for he brings
<BR>glad tidings of the King of kings.

<P>Then cleansed be every breast from sin;
<BR>make straight the way for God within,
<BR>prepare we in our hearts a home
<BR>where such a mighty Guest may come.

<P>For thou art our salvation, Lord,
<BR>our refuge and our great reward;
<BR>without thy grace we waste away
<BR>like flowers that wither and decay.

<P>To heal the sick stretch out thine hand,
<BR>and bid the fallen sinner stand;
<BR>shine forth and let thy light restore
<BR>earth's own true loveliness once more.

<P>All praise, eternal Son, to thee,
<BR>whose advent doth thy people free;
<BR>whom with the Father we adore
<BR>and Holy Ghost for evermore.
