<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. I sing the mighty power of God, that made the mountains rise, 
<BR>That spread the flowing seas abroad, and built the lofty skies. 
<BR>I sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day; 
<BR>The moon shines full at God's command, and all the stars obey. 

<P>2. I sing the goodness of the Lord, who filled the earth with food, 
<BR>Who formed the creatures through the Word, and then pronounced them good. 
<BR>Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed, where'er I turn my eye, 
<BR>If I survey the ground I tread, or gaze upon the sky. 

<P>3. There's not a plant or flower below, but makes Thy glories known, 
<BR>And clouds arise, and tempests blow, by order from Thy throne; 
<BR>While all that borrows life from Thee is ever in Thy care; 
<BR>And everywhere that we can be, Thou, God art present there.
