<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Flow river flow, flow over me. O living water, poured out for free; O living water, flow over me.

<P>1. You will be mine and I will be your God, for I will wash you clean. And a new heart, a heart of flesh and feeling, I will place within you for your heart of stone.

<P>2. The blind will see, the mute will find a voice, the lame shall leap for joy. Rivers will flow into dry and barren desert, flowere bloom in splendor, glory fill the land.

<P>3. Whoever drinks the water I will give will never thirst again. The drink I give is an everflowing river, welling up within you to give eternal life.
