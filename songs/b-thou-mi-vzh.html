<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
<BR>Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.
<BR>Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
<BR>Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

<P>Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
<BR>I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
<BR>Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
<BR>Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

<P>Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;
<BR>Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;
<BR>Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:
<BR>Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

<P>Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
<BR>Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
<BR>Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
<BR>High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

<P>High King of Heaven, my victory won,
<BR>May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!
<BR>Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
<BR>Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
