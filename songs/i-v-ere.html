<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>ME alt.HEAR MANY PEOPLE SAY, WARNING IF OPPORTUNITY <U>THERE</U>, BETTER TAKE-OPORTUNITY. WHY? OUR TIME-PERIOD SHORT. IF (2h)<U>YOU</U> PLAN++, GO-TOWARDS-GOAL.  SOMETHING IMPORTANT CAN'T WAIT. DON'T POSTPONE, NOT-THAT.  HAPPEN? CHANCE DISSOLVE FINISHwg.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> OPPORTUNITY - O,P-TRY.

<P><U>THERE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>TAKE-OPPORTUNITY - [C], PO > NDS, FO away, brushes down of [B], PO up, FO away, and then closes to [S] and DH ascends.

<P>TIME-PERIOD - [T], PO > NDS, FO up, travels in a vertical plane parallel to the NDH and makes contact with NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/main/p/period_time.swf">ASL Pro: Period - Time.</A> 

<P>GO-TOWARDS-GOAL - like the sign GOAL but the DH moves in a vertical circle while going towards the goal to show a constant process.

<P>DON'T - (2h)[B], POs down, cross at wrists, then uncross moving horizontally and emphatically. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/D/W0982.htm">ASL browser - don't</A>.

<P>NOT-THAT - (2h)[5], POs away, FOs up, wave from side to side symmetrically.

<P>CHANCE - C-TRY.   

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>I have ere this time heard many one say:
<BR>Take time while time is for time will away.
<BR>Whoso that great affairs have to be done,
<BR>Which at their own will they may despatch soon,
<BR>Let no deferings of time be used,
<BR>Lest they be far off when they would be sped.
