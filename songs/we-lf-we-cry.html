<!--<P>2. HAPPEN BABY BORN, WE FEEL INSPIRED. WE WITNESS

<P>2. A child is born among us and we feel a special glow. We see time's endless journey as we watch the baby grow. We thrill to hear imagination freely running wild. We dedicate our minds and hearts to the spirit of this child. And we believe in life, and in the strength of love; and we have found a time to be together. And with the grace of age, we share the wonder of youth, and we believe that growing is an answer.

3. Our lives are full of wonder and our time is very brief. The death of one among us fills us all with pain and grief. But as we live so shall we die
and when our lives are done the memories we shared with friends they will linger on and on. And we believe in life, and in the strength of love; and we have found a place to be together. We have the right to grow, we have the gift to believe that peace within our living is an answer.-->

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. We laugh, we cry, we live, we die;
<BR>we dance, we sing our song.
<BR>We need to feel there's something here
<BR>to which we can belong.

<P>We need to feel the freedom
<BR>just to have some time alone.
<BR>But most of all we need close friends 
<BR>we can call our very own.

<P>And we believe in life,
<BR>and in the strength of love;
<BR>and we have found a need 
<BR>to be together.

<P>We have our hearts to give,
<BR>we have our thoughts to receive;
<BR>and we believe that sharing
<BR>is an answer.

<!--<P>2. A child is born among us
<BR>and we feel a special glow.
<BR>We see time's endless journey
<BR>as we watch the baby grow.

<P>We thrill to hear imagination 
<BR>freely running wild.
<BR>We dedicate our minds and hearts 
<BR>to the spirit of this child.

<P>And we believe in life, 
<BR>and in the strength of love;
<BR>and we have found a time
<BR>to be together.

<P>And with the grace of age,
<BR>we share the wonder of youth,
<BR>and we believe that growing
<BR>is an answer.

<P>3. Our lives are full of wonder and
<BR>our time is very brief.
<BR>The death of one among us
<BR>fills us all with pain and grief.

<P>But as we live so shall we die
<BR>and when our lives are done
<BR>the memories we shared with friends
<BR>they will linger on and on.

<P>And we believe in life, 
<BR>and in the strength of love;
<BR>and we have found a place
<BR>to be together.

<P>We have the right to grow,
<BR>we have the gift to believe
<BR>that peace within our living
<BR>is an answer.-->

<P>4. We seek elusive answers to
<BR>the questions of this life.
<BR>We seek to put an end to all
<BR>the waste of human strife.

<P>We search for truth, equality, 
<BR>and blessed peace of mind.
<BR>And then, we come together here
<BR>to make sense of what we find.

<P>And we believe in life, 
<BR>and in the strength of love;
<BR>and we have found a joy
<BR>being together.

<P>And in our search of peace,
<BR>maybe we'll finally see:
<BR>even to question truly
<BR>is an answer.
