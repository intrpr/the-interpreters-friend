<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

<P>1. O sons and daughters, let us sing!
<BR>The King of heaven, the glorious King,
<BR>Over death today rose triumphing.

<P>2. That Easter morn, at break of day,
<BR>The faithful women went their way
<BR>To seek the tomb where Jesus lay.

<P>3. An angel clad in white they see,
<BR>Who sat, and spake unto the three,
<BR>"Your Lord doth go to Galilee."

<P>4. That night the apostles met in fear;
<BR>Amidst them came their Lord most dear,
<BR>And said, "My peace be on all here."

<P>5. When Thomas first the tidings heard,
<BR>How they had seen the risen Lord,
<BR>He doubted the disciples' word.

<P>6. "My pierced (wounded) side, O Thomas, see;
<BR>My hands, My feet, I show to thee;
<BR>Not faithless but believing be."

<P>7. No longer Thomas then denied;
<BR>He saw the feet, the hands, the side;
<BR>"Thou art my Lord and God," he cried.

<P>8. How blest are they who have not seen,
<BR>And yet whose faith has constant been;
<BR>For they eternal life shall win.

<P>9. On this most holy day of days
<BR>To God your hearts and voices raise,
<BR>In laud and jubilee and praise.
