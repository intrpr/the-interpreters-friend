<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Softly and gently, dearly ransomed soul, in my most loving arms I now enfold thee. And o'er the purging waters as they roll, I poise thee and I lower thee and hold thee. 

<P>2. And with great care I dip thee in the lake; and thou without a sob or resistance dost through the flood thy rapid passage take, sinking deeper into the dim distance.

<P>3. Angels to whom the willing task is given shall tend and nurse and lull thee as thou liest and masses on the earth and prayers in heaven shall aid thee at the throne of the most highest. 

<P>4. Farewell but not forever, sister/brother/loved one dear, be brave and patient on thy bed of sorrow. Swiftly shall pass the night of trial here, and I will come and wake thee on the morrow.
