<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>          

<P>1. Angels we have heard on high, 
<BR>Sweetly singing o'er the plains. 
<BR>And the mountains in reply 
<BR>Echoing their joyous strains. 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: Gloria, in excelsius Deo.
 
<P>2. Shepherd why this jubilee, 
<BR>Why your joyous strains prolong? 
<BR>What the gladsome tidings be, 
<BR>Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 
<P>3. Come to Bethlehem and see, 
<BR>Him whose birth the angels sing. 
<BR>Come adore on bended knee, 
<BR>Christ the Lord the newborn king. 

<P>4. See him in a manger laid, 
<BR>Whom the choirs of angels praise. 
<BR>Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, 
<BR>While our hearts in love we raise.
