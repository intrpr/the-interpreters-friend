<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> VIRGIN - V-GIRL.

<P>MARY - [M] touches NDS temple, is drawn across forehead, and descends. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/m/mary_a.swf">ASL Pro: Mary - 1.</A>

<P>SO-MUCH - (2h)[5:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, separate while "so much" is mouthed. 

<P>GRACE - [O^] or [S], held high and PO > Heaven, supinates and opens to [5] while being brought towards head. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=30">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Grace.</A>

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end. 

<P>(1-OF-3) - NDH [3], PO > signer, FO > DS, and DH taps thumb for "(1-OF-3)", DH [1] taps index finger for "(2-OF-3)", and taps middle finger for "(3-OF-3). 

<P><U>YOU</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>REALLY-WANT - WANT but shaken back and forth to show intensity. 

<P>INTERCEDE - The sign HELP shuttles between the signer, the interceder, and God. 

<P>CONFIDENT - TRUST.
 
<P>SUPREME - (2h)[A], FOs away, DH starts below NDH and arcs around it until it is on top. 

<P>APPROACH - (2h)[B], FOs up, DH PO away, ND is held in front of NDH and palm faces it, then both hands approach one another slightly.

<P>SIN - (2h)[X] touch their respective sides of the mouth, descend to neutral space and circle antisymmetrically parallel to the chest.

<P>SORROW - SAD+.

<P>GIVE-BIRTH - S-ENTER. Not to be confused with BORN. The child is BORN, the mother GIVE[s]-BIRTH.

<P> - (2h)[open 8], POs > people who are receiving mercy, hands move in vertical circles normal (perpendicular) to the chest.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.

<P>Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.
