<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> There is a lot of repetition in the piece, and because it is so formal and has long moments of vocal silence, proper timing can make it very dramatic. For this reason I have specified exactly how many repetitions of each part will occur. The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated twice or as specified (for example <I>5x</I> means five times).  
 
<P>GLORY - (2h)[5], POs>&lt;, FOs away from signer, DH which is on top wiggles fingers while ascending. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=28">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Glory.</A> 

<P>RELATED-TO-rt, lf, ctr - Interlinked (2h)[F] move from signer to right or to left or to center as indicated.

<P>(5x - 1 group of 3, 1 group of 2) - GLORY is repeated 5 times. To keep from looking too redundant, you can group them in a group of three where you sign it while facing slightly left (or right), then sign it while facing the other side, then sign it while facing forward. Alternating hand dominance is also aesthetic. For a group of two, sign it facing slightly to one side, and then to the other side. A group of one merely signs it while facing forward.

<P>(interlude) - This indicates that the music will continue for a bit without any choral singing.

<P>(2h)LONG-AGO - (2h)[5], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands spiral back over shoulder. 

<P>FOREVER-FUTURE~<I>FOREVER-PAST</I> - DH signs FOREVER in the usual way. NDH signs FOREVER so that is travels back over shoulder.

<P>TRINITY - NDH [B^], PO > singer, FO > DS,  is held in front of and below [3], PO > signer, FO up, and DH is brought down, under NDH, and then up in front of it while changing to [1]. For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&SubpageID=61">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Trinity.</A>

<P>AMEN - (2h)[B], FOs up, are pressed together and brought down in a long, deliberate motion. </B> For an animated gif of this sign, see <A HREF ="http://www.deafmissions.com/?PageID=18&Letter=A">Animated dictionary of religious signs - Deaf Missions: Amen.</A>
