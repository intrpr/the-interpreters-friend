<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>Said the night wind to the little lamb, 
<BR>Do you see what I see?
<BR>Way up in the sky, little lamb, 
<BR>Do you see what I see:
<BR>A star, a star, dancing in the night
<BR>With a tail as big as a kite.

<P>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, 
<BR>Do you hear what I hear
<BR>Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy? 
<BR>Do you hear what I hear:
<BR>A song, a song, high above the trees
<BR>With a voice as big as the sea.

<P>Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
<BR>Do you know what I know
<BR>In your palace warm, mighty king?
<BR>Do you know what I know:
<BR>A Child, a Child shivers in the cold.
<BR>Let us bring Him silver and gold.

<P>Said the king to the people everywhere,
<BR>Listen to what I say!
<BR>Pray for peace, people everywhere!
<BR>Listen to what I say!
<BR>The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night:
<BR>He will bring us goodness and light.
