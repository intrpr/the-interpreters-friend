<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P>(2h)COME-#BACK-TO - (2h)[B], POs > signer, FOs up, move > signer while changing to (2h)[C] and then (2h)[K].

<P>TAKE-IN - (2h)[3], POs >&lt;, FOs away, thumbs point at eye level and move several times > signer while FT wg, not thumbs. The positioning of the hands show that it could be to take it in visually or aurally.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Antiphon:</B> Turn to me, O turn, and be saved, 
<BR>says the Lord, for I am God;
<BR>There is no other, none beside me.  
<BR>I call your name. 

<P>1. I am (He that/God who) comforts you; 
<BR>who are you to be afraid 
<BR>of flesh that fades, is made like the grass of the field 
<BR>soon to wither. <B>Antiphon</B>

<P>2. Listen to me, my people; 
<BR>give ear to me, my nation:
<BR>A law will go forth from me and my justice for a light 
<BR>to the people. <B>Antiphon</B>

<P>3. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, 
<BR>and look at the earth down below.
<BR>The heavens will vanish like smoke and the earth will wear out 
<BR>like a garment. <B>Antiphon</B>
