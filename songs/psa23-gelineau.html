<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> My shepherd is the Lord, nothing shall I want.

<P>1. The Lord is my shepherd;
<BR>there is nothing I shall want.
<BR>Fresh and green are the pastures
<BR>where he gives me repose.
<BR>Near restful waters he leads me,
<BR>to revive my drooping spirit.

<P>2. He guides me along the right path;
<BR>he is true to his name.
<BR>If I should walk in the valley of darkness
<BR>no evil would I fear.
<BR>You are there with your crook and your staff;
<BR>with these you give me comfort.

<P>3. You have prepared a banquet for me
<BR>in the sight of my foes.
<BR>My head you have anointed with oil;
<BR>my cup is overflowing.

<P>4. Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me
<BR>all the days of my life.
<BR>In the Lord's own house shall I dwell
<BR>for ever and ever.

<P>5. To the Father and Son give glory 
<BR>give glory to the Spirit.
<BR>To God who is, who was, and who will be
<BR>for ever and ever.
