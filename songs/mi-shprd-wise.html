<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. The Lord is my shepherd, my shield and my stronghold, defending me soundly, redeeming my shame. He will answer my call 'til the fall 
of the mountains and cities; he's true to his name.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Alleluia, alleluia, the Lord is my shepherd and ever the same. Alleluia, alleluia, the Lord is my shepherd; he's true to his name.

<P>2. If I walk in the valley of darkness, the shadow of death, then no fear will I have; you are there with your staff and your rod,
O my god. Give me comfort, me comfort, as always you have.

<P>3. Surely goodness and kindness will always pursue me. My table is full now; my cup overflows. While my head is anointed, the time is appointed; for ever I live in the house of the Lord.

<P>4. The Lord is my shepherd, green pastures, cool water: he tenders me always, love ever the same. He will answer my call 'til the fall of the mountains and cities; he's true to his name.
