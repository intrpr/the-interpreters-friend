<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Silent night, holy night,
<BR>All is calm, all is bright
<BR>Round yon virgin mother and Child.
<BR>Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
<BR>Sleep in heavenly peace,
<BR>Sleep in heavenly peace.

<P>2. Silent night, holy night,
<BR>Shepherds quake at the sight;
<BR>Glories stream from heaven afar,
<BR>Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
<BR>Christ the Savior is born,
<BR>Christ the Savior is born!

<P>3. Silent night, holy night,
<BR>Son of God, love's pure light;
<BR>Radiant beams from Thy holy face
<BR>With the dawn of redeeming grace,
<BR>Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
<BR>Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

<P>4. Silent night, holy night
<BR>Wondrous star, lend thy light;
<BR>With the angels let us sing,
<BR>Alleluia to our King;
<BR>Christ the Savior is born,
<BR>Christ the Savior is born!
