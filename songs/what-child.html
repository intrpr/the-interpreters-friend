<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. What child is this, who laid to rest,
<BR>on Mary's lap is sleeping?
<BR>Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
<BR>while shepherds watch are keeping?

<P><B>Refrain</B>: This, this is Christ the King,
<BR>whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
<BR>haste, haste to bring him laud,
<BR>the babe, the son of Mary.

<P>2. Why lies he in such mean estate
<BR>where ox and ass are feeding?
<BR>Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
<BR>the silent Word is pleading. <B>Refrain</B>

<P>3. So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
<BR>come, peasant, king, to own him;
<BR>the King of kings salvation brings,
<BR>let loving hearts enthrone him. <B>Refrain</B>
