<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Don't I have the right, to love the one I love?
<BR>Shouldn't I be able to hold her in my arms?
<BR>Don't I have the right, and what if I were you?
<BR>You would want the right, to love somebody too.
 
<P>Longing to hold hands, and to dance, but you're too afraid,
<BR>Hiding for so long, caught up in the masquerade.
<BR>It's not as if this were planned.
<BR>What would it take for you to understand?
 
<P>Heads turn and anger burns, their thoughts turn to disgust.
<BR>Insults fly and, friendships die but, live and love we must.
<BR>Why is this world so full of bitter people, with prejudice and labels?
<BR>What if someone were to turn the tables?
 
<P>Don't I have the right? Don't I have the right?
<BR>Don't I have the right, and what if I were you?
<BR>You would want the right, to love somebody too.
<BR>Don't I have the right to love somebody too?
