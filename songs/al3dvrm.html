<P><a href="glws.html"><B>EXPLANATION OF THE GLOSSING SYSTEM<BR>(to understand how I describe the signs in this translation).</B></a></CENTER>

<P>||: WORLD REQUIRE THREE THINGS :|| HELP STAY UPRIGHT, NOT COLLAPSE. WITHOUT THREE THINGS, WORLD COLLAPSE WILL.

<P>||: (1 of 3) MUST HAVE TRUTH, MEAN alt.LIE PUT-ASIDE. (2 of 3) MUST HAVE LAW, CHAOS TAKE-HOLD CAN'T. (3 of 3) MUST HAVE PEACE. :|| 

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> This piece is very redundant, so sign slowly and repeat the translation as necessary. I have expanded the text somewhat to allow for less redundancy which is boring in ASL. In a song, hearing people will put up with repetition if the music is pretty, as in Handel's <I>Hallelujah chorus</I>. If you wish to expand it more, I think you would be justified.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. This song requires a lot of repetition, so do it ad lib. 

<P>UPRIGHT - elbow of [S], PO > NDS, FO up, - struck against the fingers of NDH [B] held like part of TABLE.

<P>(1 of 3) - List on fingers. Since it is known that there are three items, the index with strike the thumb of [3] for "(1 of 3)" and so on. 

<P>PUT-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>CHAOS - (2h)[5:], FOs away, DH is held high, PO down at its side and NDH is held low, PO up at its side. Both hands interchange PO and levels while moving slightly > DS. 

<P>TAKE-HOLD - (2h)[5:], POs away, FOs up, move down quickly and close to (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, as if grabbing hold of something. 

<P>PEACE - Since there is plenty of time, use the more elaborate form of PEACE with hands clasping one way and then the other. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>Al shlosa d'varim ha-olam kayam: al ha-emet, v'al ha-din, v'al ha-shalom.

<P>The world is established upon three things: truth, law, and peace.
