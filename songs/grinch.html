<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> CRAZY-FOR - [5:], PO > singer, FO up, is shaken slightly from side to side.

<P>GRINCH - As a name sign I use (2h)[G] to outline a frown. 

<P>TRUE-BIZ - TRUE + (2h)[S], POs down, FOs away, DH brushes from side to side across NDH wrist. 

<P>VILLAIN - (2h)[O^] are held at end of mouth and arc downwards while changing to (2h)[A], as if twirling a handlebar moustache the way villains did in silent movies.

<P>IDEA~LIKE - a blending where IDEA has a [Y] instead of an [I] in anticipation of LIKE which is signed smoothly right afterwards. 

<P>BEE - Thumb and index of [F], PO away, FO up, touch cheek, then [Bb] brushes the bee away. 

<P>STING - [X] strikes [S], PO down, FO away.

<P>GROSS - (2h)[open 8], POs >&lt;, FOs up, hands poke at each other several times with a negative face. 

<P>FART - Palm of [B] is held against NDH [S], PO down, FO > DS, then twists open and closed.

<P>GREASY - DH [open 8], PO up, FO away, grasps at [B], PO > DS, FO away, from below and pulls down several times while NDH stays in place with a negative facial expression. 

<P>MONSTER - [5:], POs down, FOs away, are held high like claws.

<P>LONG-POLE POKE - (2h)[F], POs down, FOs away, touch and separate, then (2h)[S] hold pole normal (perpendicular) to the body and poke with pole.  

<P>SKUNK - [K] draws a line above the head and down the center to show the skunk's white line. For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/S/W3673.htm">ASL browser - skunk.</A> 

<P>FILTHY - [S], PO down, FO > NDS, is held against chin and explodes open while maintaining contact with an appropriately negative facial expression. 

<P>STUFF - (2h)[bO], POs up, FOs away, are held in together in place while thumbs rub against FTs. This motion is sometimes called "pill rolling".

<P>SICK-AS-A-DOG - (2h)[V:], POs >&lt;, FOs away, move as if they are being thrown over the DS shoulder.

<P>PERVERTED - Index finger touches brain + (2h)[B], DH is held, PO > NDS, against NDPO up, FO away, and moves forward while DH FT curl > DS and HS become (B^] and facial expression is extremely negative. 

<P>HORSEMAN - Thumb of [3] touches DS temple, then moves down so that the index and middle finger straddle NDH [B], PO > DS, FO away, like mounting a horse + AGENT.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
<BR>You really are a heel.
<BR>You're as cuddly as a cactus,
<BR>You're as charming as an eel.
<BR>Mr. Grinch.

<P>You're a bad banana
<BR>With a greasy black peel.

<P>You're a monster, Mr. Grinch.
<BR>Your heart's an empty hole.
<BR>Your brain is full of spiders,
<BR>You've got garlic in your soul.
<BR>Mr. Grinch.

<P>I wouldn't touch you, with a 
<BR>thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole.

<P>You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch.
<BR>You're a nasty, wasty skunk.
<BR>Your heart is full of unwashed socks
<BR>Your soul is full of gunk.
<BR>Mr. Grinch.

<P>The three words that best describe you,
<BR>are, and I quote: "Stink. Stank. Stunk."

<P>You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch.
<BR>With a nauseaus super-naus.
<BR>You're a crooked jerky jockey
<BR>And you drive a crooked horse.
<BR>Mr. Grinch.

<P>You're a three decker saurkraut and toadstool sandwich
<BR>With arsenic sauce.
