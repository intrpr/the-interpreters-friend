<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> BOW-DOWN - (2h)[B], POs away, FOs up, are held like the final position of GIVE-UP, then bend these arms twice while bowing at waist once. 

<P>HEAVENLY-FATHER - (2h)[A], FOs up, DH is held against forehead, NDH close to  but lower, both hands open to (2h)[5] while moving upwards. HEAVEN may be added to this. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/heavenlyfather_a.swf">ASL Pro: Heavenly Father - 1.</A> 

<P><U>THE</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>HOLY - H-CLEAN. For a QuickTime file of this sign, see <A HREF="http://www.aslpro.com/religious/h/holy_a.swf">ASL Pro: Holy - 1.</A> 

<P>THROW-DOWN-INTO

<P>EAT-UP-body - (2h)[5:] touches FT to chest and close and open as they travel
up the chest, as if taking small bites of it, while gnashing the teeth with each bite.

<P>STINK - [G with other fingers extended] moves > nose as if to hold nostrils, but does not need to reach the nose. 

<P>RISE - GET-UP.

<P>SET-ASIDE - (2h)[B], POs > DS, with DH higher, palms are pressed against imaginary wall that is pushed to one side.

<P>The signs between "||:" and ":||" are to be repeated. 

<P>KNOW-THAT - Starts like KNOW but twists and descends, looking almost like DON'T-KNOW except the hand twists down at the end.

<P>COME-ON - (2h)[B^] move in circles pivoting at the wrists to beckon someone to do something. 

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P>1. I bow down to the Father, blessed Son and the Holy Spirit,
<BR>For if I received what I deserve, surely I would be cast into
<BR>Consuming Fire, burning sulfur, eternal distance from my Father
<BR>But the Son has risen from the grave and now I say:

<P>||: (4x) I will not bow down ::|
<BR>To any other gods.

<P>2. Surely the sun will be shining on the day we enter heaven
<BR>And see the Father and blessed Jesus, smiling warmly as he says to us
<BR>"Come and join me for eternity at my table with your family."
<BR>For the Son has risen from the grave, and now I sing:

<P>||: (4x) We will not bow down ::|
<BR>To any other gods.
