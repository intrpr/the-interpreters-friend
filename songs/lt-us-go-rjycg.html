<P>TEMPLE - T-CHURCH.

<P><U>THEY</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P>JERUSALEM - [B with thumbs flush with other fingers but not folded into palm], touches mouth and then pronates. 

<P>PAH! - Like SUCCEED but "pah" is mouthed and has the meaning of "at long last". For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/f/W1252.htm">ASL browser - finally</A>. 

<P>CIRCULAR-WALL - (2H)[Bb], POs away, FOs up, hands are touching, separate and return further away (moving in a circle) to show a circular wall.
