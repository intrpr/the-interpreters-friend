<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come back to me, with all your heart. Don't let fear keep us apart. Trees do bend, though straight and tall; so must we to others' call. 

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Long have I waited for your coming home to me and living deeply our new life.

<P>2. The wilderness will lead you to your heart where I will speak. Integrity and justice with tenderness you shall know.

<P>3. You shall sleep secure with peace; faithfulness will be your joy.
