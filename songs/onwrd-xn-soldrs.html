<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war,
<BR>With the cross of Jesus Going on before.
<BR>Christ, the royal master, Leads against the foe;
<BR>Forward into battle See his banners go!

<P><B>Refrain:</B> Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war,
<BR>With the cross of Jesus Going on before.

<P>2. Like a might army Moves the Church of God;
<BR>Brothers, we are treading Where the saints have trod.
<BR>We are not divided, All one body we,
<BR>One in hope and doctrine, One in charity.

<P>3. Crowns and thrones may perish, Kingdoms rise and wane,
<BR>But the Church of Jesus Constant will remain.
<BR>Gates of hell can never 'Gainst that Church prevail;
<BR>We have Christ's own promise, And that cannot fail.

<P>4. Onward, then, ye faithful, Join our happy throng,
<BR>Blend with ours your voices In the triumph song;
<BR>Glory, laud, and honor Unto Christ, the king;
<BR>This through countless ages Men and angels sing.
