<P>Adam lay ybounden,
<BR>Bounden in a bond;
<BR>Four thousand winter
<BR>Thought he not too long.

<P>All for an apple,
<BR>An apple that he took,
<BR>As clerk&egrave; finden
<BR>Written in their book.

<P>Ne had the apple taken been,
<BR>The apple taken been,
<BR>Ne had never our lady
<BR>Abeen heaven&egrave; queen.

<P>Bless&egrave;d be the time
<BR>That apple taken was,
<BR>Therefore we moun singen,
<BR>Deo gracias! Deo gracias!
