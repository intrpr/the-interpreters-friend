<P>WHEN ME HEAR THUNDER, 
<BR>REALIZE GOLD TIME-PERIOD END.  
<BR>WE HOPE"over time" STAY YOUNG FOREVER, 
<BR>BUT STRUGGLE MAKE US OLD*, EXHAUSTED.  
<BR>WHEN MY SPIRIT BREAK-DOWN WORSHIP OLD IDEA #NO-GOOD 
<BR>AND MY (2h)IMAGINE FAIL.  
<BR>ME GO-AHEAD ANYWAY CAN.  ME GO-AHEAD.  
<BR>ME GO-AHEAD SAY, ME CELEBRATE TOMORROW WILL.  
<BR>ME GO-AHEAD LIVE.  SUPPOSE TOMORROW SCREWED-UP 
<BR>AND EVERYTHING I LOVE GONE, #DO-DO?  
<BR>ME APPROACH REGRET 
<BR>FROM-NOW-ON FOREVER.  
<BR>BUT STILL ME GO-AHEAD.  
<BR>CRAZY-FOR LORD, CRAZY-FOR.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>When the thunder rumbles  
<BR>Now the Age of Gold is dead 
<BR>And the dreams we've clung to dying to stay young 
<BR>Have left us parched and old instead. 
<BR>When my spirit falters on decaying altars 
<BR>And my illusions fail, 
<BR>I go right on then. I go on again. 
<BR>I go on to say I will celebrate another day... 
<BR>I go on... If tomorrow tumbles 
<BR>And everything I love is gone 
<BR>I will face regret 
<BR>All my days, and yet 
<BR>I will still go on. 
<BR>Lauda, Lauda, Lauda Lauda, 
<BR>Lauda di da di day.
