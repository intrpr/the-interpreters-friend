<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> <U>ME</U> - Underlined words are honorific indices ("indexes"), using the FT of the upturned palm to indicate who is being honored.

<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
<BR>When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
<BR>Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
<BR>Until you come and sit awhile with me.

<P><B>Refrain:</B> ||: You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
<BR>You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
<BR>I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
<BR>You raise me up... To more than I can be. :||

<P>2. There is no life, no life without its hunger;
<BR>Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
<BR>But then you come, and I am filled with wonder;
<BR>Sometimes I think, I glimpse eternity.
