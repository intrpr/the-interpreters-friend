<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne.
<BR>Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone.
<BR>Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood.
<BR>Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.

<P>2. Alleluia! King eternal, Thee the Lord of Lords we own;
<BR>Alleluia! born of Mary, Earth Thy footstool, Heav'n Thy throne:
<BR>Thou within the veil hast entered, robed in flesh our great High Priest;
<BR>Thou on earth both priest and victim in the Eucharistic feast.

<P>3. Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to God on high; 
<BR>Alleluia to the Savior who has won the victory; 
<BR>Alleluia to the Spirit, font of love and sanctity;
<BR>Alleluia! Alleluia! to the triune majesty.
