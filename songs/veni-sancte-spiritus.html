<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Come, Holy Spirit, come,
<BR>and from your celestial home
<BR>shed a ray of light divine.

<P>2. Come, Father of the poor,
<BR>Come, source of all our store.
<BR>Come, within our bosoms shine.

<P>3. You, of comforters best;
<BR>You the soul's most welcome guest.
<BR>Sweet refreshment here below.

<P>4. In our labor, rest most sweet;
<BR>Grateful coolness in the heat;
<BR>Solace in the midst of woe.

<P>5. O most Blessed Light Divine,
<BR>shine within these hearts of thine,
<BR>and our inmost being fill.

<P>6. Where you are not, we have naught.
<BR>Nothing good in deed or thought
<BR>Nothing free from taint of ill.

<P>7. Heal our wounds, our strength renew;
<BR>On our dryness pour your dew;
<BR>Wash the stains of guilt away.

<P>8. Bend the stubborn heart and will.
<BR>Melt the frozen, warm the chill.
<BR>Guide the steps that go astray.

<P>9. On the faithful, who adore.
<BR>And confess you, evermore.
<BR>In Your sev'nfold gift descend.

<P>10. Give us virtue's sure reward.
<BR>Give us your salvation, Lord.
<BR>Give us joys that never end.
<BR>Amen. Alleluia.
