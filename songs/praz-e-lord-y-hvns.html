<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. Praise the Lord! Ye heavens adore him; praise him angels in the height. Sun and moon rejoice before him; praise him all ye stars of light. Praise the Lord for he has spoken; Worlds his mighty voice obeyed. Laws which never shall be broken for their guidance he has made.

<P>2. Praise the Lord! for he is glorious; never shall his promise fail. God has made his saints victorious; Sin and death shall not prevail. Praise the Lord of our salvation! Hosts on high his powers proclaim. Heaven and earth and all creation laud and magnify his name.

<P>3. Worship, honor, glory, blessing, Lord we offer unto thee. Young and old thy praise expressing, in glad homage bend the knee. All the saints in heaven adore thee; We would bow before thy throne. As thy angels serve before thee, so on earth thy will be done.
