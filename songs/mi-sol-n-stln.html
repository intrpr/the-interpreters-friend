<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B> 

<P><B>Refrain</B>: For you, O lord, my soul in stillness waits. Truly my hope is in you.

<P>1. O Lord of Light, our only hope of glory, your radiance shines in all who look to you. Come light the hearts of all in dark and shadow. 

<P>2. O Spring of Joy, rain down upon our spirits. Our thirsty hearts are yearning for your Word. Come, make us whole; be comfort to our hearts. 

<P>3. O Root of Life, implant your seed within us, and in your advent draw us all to you, our hope reborn in dying and in rising.          

<P>4. O Key of Knowledge, guide us in our pilgrimage, We ever seek, yet unfulfilled remain. Open to us the pathway of your peace.          

<P>5. Come, let us bow before the God who made us. Let every heart be opened to the Lord, for we are all the people of his hand.        

<P>6. Here we shall meet the makers of the heavens, creator of the mountains and the seas, Lord of the stars and present to us now.
