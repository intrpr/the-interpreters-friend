<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P>1. The King of love my shepherd is,
<BR>whose goodness faileth never;
<BR>I nothing lack if I am his,
<BR>and he is mine for ever.

<P>2. Where streams of living water flow,
<BR>my ransomed soul he leadeth,
<BR>and where the verdant pastures grow,
<BR>with food celestial feedeth.

<P>3. Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
<BR>but yet in love He sought me,
<BR>and on his shoulder gently laid,
<BR>and home, rejoicing, brought me.

<P>4. In death's dark vale I fear no ill
<BR>with thee, dear Lord, beside me;
<BR>thy rod and staff my comfort still,
<BR>thy cross before to guide me.

<P>5. Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
<BR>thy unction grace bestoweth;
<BR>and O what transport of delight
<BR>from thy pure chalice floweth!

<P>6. And so through all the length of days
<BR>thy goodness faileth never:
<BR>Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise
<BR>within thy house for ever.
