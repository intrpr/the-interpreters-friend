<P><B><U>Lyrics</U>:</B>

<P><B>Refrain:</B> The Lord Is my hope and my glory. 
<BR>The Lord is the song that I sing: 
<BR>so tender and loving a shepherd, 
<BR>so rooted in justice, a king (merciful king). 
<BR>When shadow confuses my vision, 
<BR>when sorrow lays claim to my heart, 
<BR>God is my refuge, my rock and my shield. 
<BR>I will rely on the Lord. 

<P>1. Near to death I cried, "Save me!" and you heard.
<BR>You are God, and you lift up the poor.

<P>2. Kingdoms fall; nations tremble at your power.
<BR>None can stand without you at their side.

<P>3. Justice reigns, and the wicked are cast down.
<BR>In your love is our safety and strength.

<P>4. All who trust in your promise will be saved, 
<BR>for your word has been tested in fire.

<P>5. Morning comes: I will praise you with my life,
<BR>ever faithful and true to your word.
