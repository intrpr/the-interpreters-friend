<CENTER><H2>Overuse Syndrome among Sign Language interpreters.</H2>
<H3>Gary Sanderson</H3></CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">

<P>In the past four or five years an epidemic has hit our field. Most of
us know it as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). It can more appropriately called
Overuse Syndrome or Repetitive Strain Injury. And, yes. it seems there
is an epidemic. The Southern California Registry of Interpreters for the
Deaf did a survey of its membership and found that approximately 44% of
those responding had some form of overuse syndrome. If the results of this
survey can be generalized across the country, then the field of interpretation
is facing a crisis, which, if not addressed now, could leave many in our
field permanently disabled. Overuse syndrome is not a new condition. Thousands
of cases of Overuse Syndrome are reported annually from other fields.

<P>In reviewing the literature of our field, no mention is made of Overuse
Syndrome from the publication of the first text, Interpreting for the Deaf,
in 1964 to Interpreting: an Introduction, published in 1986. This could
explain, in part, why Overuse Syndrome has apparently caught most of us
unaware.

<P>This epidemic facing us is not just CTS. It is a set of syndromes that
can hit anyone at anytime. But why is it hitting now? Why hasn't it been
around since Ball State? Perhaps a brief look at the changes in the field
of interpretation can explain what may have lead us into this epidemic.

<P>For many years, interpreting was done by friends and family member so
deaf people. As deaf people began to move more and more into the mainstream,
the need for interpreters grew. The pool of friends and family was no longer
able to meet the expanding need. As interpreting evolved into a profession,
its earliest practitioners were "part-time." As the need for interpreting
continued to grow, more and more people began to interpret for a living
and not to supplement the family income or to put themselves through school.
These people found themselves interpreting more and more.

<P>At the same time, the profession of interpreting was growing up around
these people. Finally, interpreters have a "profession," but none of the
trappings of other professions, i.e. benefits, job descriptions, unions,
or job security. In order for most interpreters to keep their heads above
water financially, we have to interpret any and all assignments to pay
for normal living expenses such as health insurance and rent. Instead of&nbsp;
heeding the warning signs our bodies have been giving us, we have kept
on working and working (and still do ) "just in case." "Just in case" there
is no work next week or "just in case" spring break is coming up. The list
of "just in case's" is endless. So interpreters work all day, every day,
and "just in case" interprets a few night jobs too.
<H3>
What is Overuse Syndrome?</H3>
It is not just CTS, even though that is what we hear about all the time.
In addition to CTS Overuse Syndrome may include all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp;brachial neuralgia</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;tendinitis</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;ulnar nerve entrapment</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;De Quevains Disease</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;ganglion cysts</LI>
</UL>
Simply put, Overuse Syndrome is a condition which develops when a group
of muscles are repeatedly used without allowing adequate rest periods.

<P>Excessive repetitive movements with out adequate rest breaks cause micro-traumas
to the tissues. With a rest break, the body can heal itself. Without the
break, the body then begins its inflammatory response in order to heal
the injury. During the inflammatory response, the body sends signals to
let us know that the healing process has begun: redness, pain, swelling,
warmth and loss of range the range of motion. If, during the healing process,
the muscles are used repeatedly, the injured area begins to swell more
and more edema can develop. In some cases hemorrhaging may occur.

<P>The progress of Overuse Syndrome from a minor discomfort to disability
has been documented by Stone (1984). In his article on Overuse among people
employed as word processors, Dr. Stone proposes the following gradings
of pain associated with Overuse, along with his recommendations:
<H3>
GRADE ONE</H3>

<UL>Pain is present only when performing duties; daily activities are not
interfered with. No signs are evident.</UL>

<H3>
GRADE TWO</H3>

<UL>Pain remains after completion of duties; but subsides by evening; daily
life is interfered with only mildly. There is mild tenderness.

<P>Grades one and two can be maintained at work with some modification
of work duties</UL>

<H3>
GRADE THREE</H3>

<UL>Pain continues throughout evening, is not present on waking, but recurs
shortly after beginning duties. Daily living is interfered with. Signs
will be evident.

<P>Grade three requires absence from work. The length of time depends on
recovery time and job modifications.</UL>

<H3>
GRADE FOUR</H3>

<UL>Pain is present at waking on each working day and at night; usually
subsides on week-ends and days off. Daily life is effected significantly.

<P>Grade four people can seldom return to the same job unless they are
off for months</UL>

<H3>
GRADE FIVE</H3>

<UL>Pain is continuous; daily life is restricted substantially.

<P>Grade five people can rarely return to the work force.</UL>
Symptoms/signs frequently mentioned by people with Overuse at the various
grades are: burning sensations, tingling of the fingers, numbness, spasms,
redness, tenderness, and swelling.

<P>Along with the physical symptoms, many people mention that the non-physical
symptoms are even more disturbing. These are what Stone refers to when
he says ,"Daily life is interfered with." People begin to feel clumsy,
small tasks become difficult or painful, i.e., brushing your teeth, writing,
picking up a coffee cup. Many times, this leads to self-doubt on the part
of the person experiencing the pain. Since these people evidence no physical
signs that others can easily see, they begin to deny the existence of the
pain.

<P>Unfortunately, current research on Overuse Syndrome does not mention
sign language interpreting as a cause. There is, however, research being
done on interpreters. California State University, Northridge has completed
a study of 27 interpreters with Overuse Syndromes and will be publishing
their results soon. The RID has an <I>Ad Hoc </I>committee looking into
the long term physical effects of interpreting. SCRID has done surveys
in southern California. Results of these studies will be published in the
near future.

<P>In the meantime what can be done? Is this something that we just have
to accept as part of our job? No. Much as "Little League Elbow" has been
eliminated, Overuse among sign language interpreters can be eliminated
as well. Little League authorities recognized a problem among its pitchers
known as "Little League Elbow." After looking into the causes, rules were
established as to how many consecutive innings could be pitched, how long
the boys were allowed to practice, and so forth. The result is that today
Little League Elbow is no longer a problem. We must view Overuse Syndromes
among sign language interpreters in a similar manner.

<P>Beginning in introductory ASL classes, we must introduce conditioning
programs to increase the physical strength and endurance of new signers.
The "signer-cises" in the appendix were developed by a physical therapist
at California State University, Northridge specifically for sign language
interpreters. By encouraging students to begin exercising when they enter
sign language programs, we can prevent problems later on.

<P>Exercises are not enough, however. We must be aware of bodies and how
we treat them. Our field has spent a good deal of time and energy in comparing
itself with that of spoken language interpreters in order to achieve the
level of professional recognition we now have. But in doing so, we have
neglected a major factor which distinguishes sign language interpreters
from spoken language interpreters: In addition to being language interpreters,
we are also athletes and dancers. Every time we lift up our arms to interpret,
we begin a mini-workout. Yet we have chosen to ignore the basic tenet all
athletes and dancers follow: Never begin a game or a workout with first
worming up and stretching out first. Yet we walk into each interpreting
assignment cold--physically and temperature wise. It is time for us to
wake up to the fact we are not only interpreters but athletes too.

<P>Below is a list of hints compiled from various sources. Although they
can not guarantee you will never develop a problem, they may help in prevention.

<P>1. Provide longer training periods for new signers and interpreters
to increase hand and wrist strength. For everyone, who is not in pain now,
begin doing Signer-cises now.

<P>2. Always warm up prior to interpreting. Remember to think of yourself
as not only an interpreter but as an athlete or a dancer.

<P>3. Maintain good overall health.

<P>4. Know your stress indicators. Stress may play a role in aggravating
the condition.

<P>5. Never interpret when your hands are cold. Always warm them up first.

<P>6. Avoid sitting under air conditioning vents.

<P>7. Have someone evaluate your interpreting for posture, fingerspelling
position (wrist too pronated, bent outward, arm too high), rest position,
and signing position.

<P>8. Before going into an assignment that may be difficult or has proven
stressful in the past, try guided imagery, relaxation exercises, or meditation.

<P>9. If, during a job, you find yourself stressing out or tensing up,
try taking several deep cleansing breaths.

<P>10. <U>Do not</U> switch dominant hands.

<P>11. After a full day of interpreting "cool down." ( watch joggers at
stoplights)

<P>12. After sitting for a long time your blood pools causing your shoulder
and neck muscles to tense up. When you get up stretch out a bit to cool
down.

<P>13. Turn down any assignment over two hours that has no breaks or demand
a back up interpreter.

<P>14. Check for chairs which allow for good posture.

<P>15. Change positions while you are interpreting: When standing: cradle
your hands, put hands in pockets, shake out your hands, quickly massage
hands/arms. When sitting: drop arms to side, massage hands, rest hands
in lap

<P>16. Increase sign vocabulary to decrease fingerspelling.

<P>17. Make sure your hobbies are not part of the cause: i.e., knitting,
writing, piano, needlepoint etc.

<P>The above are for someone who is not experiencing any pain. If you are
in pain a different approach should be taken. The most important thing
to remember is not to deny it. Do not say " This can't be happening to
me." Do not deny it!

<P>1. Seek medical attention. Keep your supervisor advised of your condition.
Begin investigating workers compensation procedures for your state if applicable.

<P>2. Rest. The study done at CSUN showed that rest was the only treatment
that helped across the board for all interpreters. The condition will not
go away if you deny it. Rest means to stop nay activity that causes pain
i.e., signing, fingerspelling, knitting etc.

<P>3. Should your doctor suggest surgery, regard this as a last resort
procedure. Ask for a referral to a physical therapist or a chiropractor.
They have had success in treating overuse in a non-surgical manner.

<P>4. If your doctor does not prescribe medication, you may take aspirin
((not tylenol). Take two tablets four times a day <U>with food </U>for
five days. Aspirin, like antibiotics, has a cumulative effect.

<P>5. Use a wrist brace to restrict movement. Wearing a tight brace may
reduce pain, but it also reduces circulation. Make sure the brace is fastened
so as to restrict movement, but not circulation. Sleep with your brace
on. This way you do not inadvertently sleep on your hand or arm and hurt
it.

<P>6. Discontinue doing "signer-cises" or any exercises until your doctor
tells you that you may resume them.

<P>7. Do not shake your hands out! This causes only more damage if you
are in pain.

<P>When resuming your work activities <U>you</U> must look out for yourself.

<P>1. Do not return to the dame work schedule. See your supervisor to modify
it. Suggest rearranging your hours to include adequate breaks, team interpreting,
more sign to voice interpreting, working with intern interpreters, etc.
For supervisors this means employing creative scheduling to keep with in
budgets.

<P>2. You can interpret with a brace on if necessary.

<P>3. Have someone observe your interpreting style, making sure you are
not doing something which is aggravating the condition.

<P>4. After the pain and inflammation have gone away, begin a reconditioning
program. Do not exercise if you are in pain.

<P>5. Monitor your condition. If the pain begins again, cut back on your
activity. Be good to yourself.

<P>By following these procedures, the Communication Services Unit of the
National Center on Deafness at California State University, Northridge
has been able to reduce the number of reported cases of Overuse from 37
two years ago to 2 this semester. Interpreter trainers, employers who hire
interpreters, and interpreters themselves must work together to reduce
this problem, if not eliminate it.
