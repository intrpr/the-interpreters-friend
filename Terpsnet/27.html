<P>Oct. 11, 1998 -- Throughout this year California's court interpreters
have waged a courageous lobbying effort to convince the state legislature
to grant them a well-deserved and long overdue salary increase. In fact,
for the first time ever, they proudly staged pickets and walkouts in the
San Francisco and Los Angeles court districts, momentarily leaving the
two court systems in disarray.

<P>They succeeded with the legislators. A limited $6 million fund was included
in the state budget approved for the 1998-1999 fiscal year.

<P>But contrary to their hopes, for the eighth consecutive year, they will
not be receiving the raise. Their share of the pie fell victim to the draconian
last-minute, $1.5 billion line-item budget slash imposed by lame duck Gov.
Pete Wilson.

<P>Not surprisingly, Latino interpreters -- by far the majority affected
-- feel this is one more injury by Republicans against their community.

<P>Court interpreters comprise a professional workforce in this country
that ensures monolingual or limited-English-speaking defendants and plaintiffs
the fundamental right of equal access to due process. This right is guaranteed
by the 4th, 5th, 6th and 14th amendments of our Constitution.

<P>Historically, the United States has provided language services to the
non-English-speaking. Nowhere is this more clear than in director Steven
Spielberg's epic "Amistad.'' It was through the language skills of a former
slave turned U.S. sailor that Cinque, the film's protagonist, was able
to narrate the truth about the slave ship, successfully refuting the arguments
of ownership of the despicable slave traders and a Spanish monarchy backed
by a U.S. administration fearful of escalating the imminent civil war.

<P>The finding of the interlocutor was the turning point of the case, elucidating
the path all the way to the Supreme Court. Before then, the accused did
not have a voice nor did they understand the proceedings. In effect, they
were not there. Due to inadequate interpretation, case law is replete with
injustices as far back as 1809 (Amory v. Fellowes).

<P>A case in point is that of Texas folk-hero Gregorio Cortez in 1906.
During an investigation, key misinterpretations by a Texas Ranger caused
the death of Gregorio's brother and two sheriffs and initiated the largest
single manhunt ever in the infamous history of the Rangers.

<P>Gregorio ended up serving 12 years in prison, all because he denied
having traded a caballo, which denotes a male horse in Spanish. In reality
he had traded a yegua, a mare. Cortez died soon after his release from
prison. His story was immortalized in the film "The Ballad of Gregorio
Cortez'' (Esparza-Young 1983).

<P>A more recent example is the 1977 Arizona trial of the Hanigan ranchers.
That incident involved three young undocumented immigrants who, after crossing
the Arizona border in the desert, ventured desperately onto the Hanigans'
ranch looking for water. The immigrants were abducted, severely tortured
and shot by the Hanigans.

<P>During the trial, the substandard interpretation exhibited gross errors,
which the defense counsel used to soften the testimony of the victims.
The jury, experts say, became confused and exonerated the Hanigans. Immediately,
a national uproar by Latinos and civil libertarians prompted the U.S. Justice
Department to file charges against the Hanigans for interfering with interstate
commerce.

<P>Today, notwithstanding the rising anti-bilingual mood in our society
and to the chagrin of English-only proponents, the United States court
system is unequivocally bilingual. The Federal Court Interpreters Act of
1978, an outgrowth of civil rights legislation signed by President Carter,
mandates the use of qualified interpreters in any civil or criminal actions
initiated by the United States involving non-English-speakers. Just as
important, the law calls for the certification of interpreters.

<P>The certification process is extremely difficult and rigorous, comparable
to what court reporters endure. California's examination results for fiscal
year 1997-1998 clearly reveal it. Out of 578 tested, only 14 percent passed.
For Spanish and Korean, the two languages most in demand in California,
the results were even lower.

<P>Statistics on a federal level are more compelling. Since 1985, out of
17,000 tested, less than 800 have been certified.

<P>Interpreters labor at breakneck speeds, moving from 120 to 200 words
per minute in the simultaneous mode. In the consecutive method, they are
required to retain 65 or more words in one breath. They continuously move
back and forth in two different cultural linguistics, and understanding
the concept is crucial.

<P>Retaining the essential, in a split second they decodefy it to the target
language. All this while observing semantic rules and adding paralinguistic
meaning such as uhs, ohs, well, ahas and silence.

<P>The interpreter has to manage and conceptualize thousands of terms and
be well versed in more than 20 specialized and technical areas such as
forensic, DNA, slang, etc.

<P>Additionally -- and a very difficult task -- he or she must interpret
in the language level of the courts, i.e., a 14th grade level, including
legalese jargon commonly referred to as frozen language, dating back to
the 14th century. As you can see, the interpreter becomes an incredible
mind machine.

<P>Yet, with the exception of Federal court interpreters, the pay for this
estimated 100,000 professionals ranges from $60 to $210 a day, with no
benefits.

<P>Unfortunately, there is an ingrained societal attitude against interpreters,
primarily stemming out of a bias which public and private institutions
exploit to their benefits. The root of the problem lies with the clientele
interpreters serve. It is composed of immigrants, minorities and the underclass.

<P>"For this, interpreters are sneered at by association,'' says Dr. Roseanne
Duenas Gonzalez, director of the University of Arizona's National Center
for Interpretation Testing, Research and Policy. In the age of globalization,
this reality does not bode well for the United States. Unions should take
note, because this industry has zero collective bargaining rights established.

<P>On the other hand, interpreters do still maintain a provincial political
outlook. They have yet to discover the rich and historical experience of
organized public service employees.

<P>Unless they begin to expand their horizon, they will enter the new millennium
without a better future.
