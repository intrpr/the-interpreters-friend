<P>It shall be the duty of all translators:

<P>1. To translate with
the greatest fidelity and accuracy they can command, endeavoring always
to give their readers and audiences the impression they would have if they
could read or hear the original.</P>

<P>2. To maintain professional
discretion and in particular to respect the rights of their clients or
employers by divulging nothing they may have learned in their professional
capacity that is harmful to their interests; and to derive no personal
profit or advantage from any confidential information they may have acquired
in their professional capacity.</P>

<P>3. To accept no assignment
for which they know themselves to be less than well qualified in either
language or understanding of the subject, except with the prior knowledge
of their clients or employers; and to refuse any assignment which they
believe they cannot properly complete within the time allowed.</P>

<P>4. To s loopbackhare
professional knowledge with their colleagues on a reciprocal basis.</P>

<P>
5. To refrain from
any action likely to discredit the profession, and in particular to abstain
from engaging in unfair competition.</P>

<P>
6. To seek or accept
no work on terms that are humiliating to them or to the profession.</P>

<P>7. To refuse any assignment
that they believe to be intended for illegal or dishonest purposes, or
against the public intere To be loyal to their colleagues and to their
profession and to agree to settle professional differences by arbitration
whenever possible.</P>

<P>All translators shall have the right:

<P>1. To receive the same
consideration and the same status as are generally according the members
of other professions, including prompt payment for their services.</P>

<P>2. To charge such professional
fees as are commensurate with their experience, degree of specialized knowledge
and quality of work, taking into account such guidelines as may be laid
down by their professional society.</P>

<P>3. To demand working
conditions that will enable them to perform their services with efficiency
and dignity.</P>

<P>4. To refuse to quote
a fee on a competition basis or without having seen the work to be translated.</P>

<P>5. To seek, by legislation
or other means, the same social and fiscal benefits and tax classifications
granted to members of other professions.</P>

<P>6. To enjoy in the
case of translations intended for publication or performance, equitable
publicity of the kind traditionally granted authors of technical, literary,
and dramatic works, including mention of their names on the title pages
and jackets of published translations, or in theater programs, and in the
advertising of their translations by the publishers or producers.</P>

<P>7. To share, in the
case of commercially published or produced works, in the fortunes of their
translations, and in particular to receive a proportional share of the
royalties as well as an advance payment.</P>

<P>8. To insist, in the
case of translations intended for publication or performance, that no substantial
changes be made without their consent or, alternatively, that their names
be removed as translator or adapter, without prejudice to the agreed payment.</P>
