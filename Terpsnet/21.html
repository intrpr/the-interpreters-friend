<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="PREAMBLE"></A>PREAMBLE</H2>

<P>Many persons who come before the courts are partially or completely
excluded from full participation in the proceedings because of limited
English proficiency or a speech or hearing impairment. It is essential
that the resulting communications barrier be removed, as far as possible,
so that these persons are placed in the same position as similarly situated
persons for whom there is no such barrier.1 An interpreter is sworn in
as an officer of the court. As an officer of the court, an interpreter
is a neutral and impartial participant who assists the court in ensuring
that court proceedings and court support services are accessible and function
efficiently and effectively. The court interpreter is a skilled professional,
therefore, who fulfills an essential role in the administration of justice.
At a minimum, an interpreter must be a &quot;qualified interpreter,&quot;
under ORS 45.275 (7)-(8), to serve in the courts in Oregon. However, ORS
45.288 requires the court to give preference for appointments to an interpreter
certified under ORS 45.291. In other words, the court is required by ORS
45.288 to appoint a certified interpreter if a certified interpreter is
available, able, and willing to serve. If no certified interpreter is available,
able, and willing to serve, an interpreter still must meet the statutory
requirements for qualification contained in ORS 45.275 (7)-(8) and ORS
45.288(3)-(4), and state his or her qualifications on the record as in
ORS 45.275 (7).</P>

<H2><A NAME="APPLICABILITY"></A>APPLICABILITY</H2>

<P>This code shall guide all persons, agencies, and organizations who administer,
supervise use of, or deliver interpreting services to the courts. Ensuring
equal access to the communication, however, may on occasion conflict with
this code. When unique situations necessitate an exception to the rules
in order to ensure effective communication, the court may so allow.</P>

<P>For clarification of this code, the following definitions should be
kept in mind. Interpreting is rendering an oral statement from one language
into an oral statement to another language. Sight translation is rendering
written material into oral form. Translation is rendering written material
from one language into written form in another language.</P>

<P>Violations of this code may result in the interpreter being deleted
from a court's list of qualified and/or certified interpreters.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS"></A>1. ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall render a complete and accurate interpretation
or sight translation, without altering, omitting anything from, or adding
anything to what is stated or written, and without explanation.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>The interpreter has a twofold duty: 1) to ensure that the proceedings
in English reflect precisely what was said by a non-English speaking person,
and 2) to place the non-English speaking person on an equal footing with
those who understand English. This creates an obligation to conserve every
element of information contained in a source language communication when
it is rendered in the target language.</P>

<P>Therefore, the interpreter is obligated to apply the interpreter's best
skills and judgment to faithfully preserve the meaning of what is said
in court, including the style or register of speech. Verbatim, &quot;word
for word,&quot; or literal oral translations are not appropriate when they
distort the meaning of the source language, but every spoken statement,
even if it appears nonresponsive, obscene, rambling, or incoherent, should
be interpreted. This includes apparent misstatements.</P>

<P>The interpreter should never interject his or her own words, phrases,
or expressions. If the need arises to explain an interpreting problem,
(e.g., a term or phrase with no direct equivalent in the target language
or a misunderstanding that only the interpreter can clarify), the interpreter
should ask the court's permission to provide an explanation. The interpreter
of an oral language should convey the emotional emphasis of the speaker,
but it may be in a slightly diminished form. If the witness weeps during
questioning, the interpreter should not weep. Imitating the weeping might
appear to mock the witness. Sadness can be conveyed by tone of voice alone.
The judge and jury can see a witness' emotions for themselves even if they
do not understand the target language.</P>

<P>A sign language interpreter, however, must employ all of the visual
cues that the language he or she is interpreting requires--including facial
expressions and body language, in addition to sign language. A sign language
interpreter, therefore, should ensure that court participants do not confuse
these essential elements of the interpreted language with inappropriate
interpreter conduct.</P>

<P>The obligation to preserve accuracy includes the interpreter's duty
to correct, in a timely fashion, any error of interpretation discovered
by the interpreter during the proceeding. The interpreter should demonstrate
professionalism by objectively analyzing any challenge to his or her performance.</P>

<H2><A NAME="REPRESENTATIONS OF QUALIFICATIONS"></A>2. REPRESENTATIONS
OF QUALIFICATIONS</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall accurately and completely represent his or her
certifications, training, and pertinent experience. The court should reassess
the interpreter's qualifications each time the interpreter is engaged to
interpret in court for a non-English speaking party or witness.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>Acceptance of a case by the interpreter implies the interpreter's linguistic
competency in legal settings. Withdrawing or being asked to withdraw from
a case after it begins causes a disruption of court proceedings and is
wasteful of scarce public resources. It is therefore essential that the
interpreter present a complete and truthful account of the interpreter's
training, certification, and experience prior to appointment so the court
can fairly evaluate the interpreter's qualifications for delivering interpreting
services.</P>

<H2><A NAME="IMPARTIALITY"></A>3. IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT
OF INTEREST--COURT OR PROCEEDING INTERPRETER</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall be impartial and unbiased and shall refrain from
conduct that may give an appearance of bias or conflict of interest. The
interpreter shall disclose to the judge any real bias or interest in the
parties or witnesses in a case, or any situation or relationship that may
be perceived by the court, any of the parties, or any witnesses as a bias
or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case. </P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>When appointed by the court to act as a proceeding interpreter, the
interpreter's &quot;clients&quot; are all of the parties and witnesses
in the court case. Because of this, it is important that the interpreter
have no real or perceived interest in any of the parties or witnesses beyond
the professional interest of interpreting for the non-English speaking
parties and witnesses in the court case.</P>

<P>Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter
constitutes a conflict of interest. Before providing services in a matter,
the court interpreter must disclose to all parties and the court any prior
involvement in the case or with the parties or witnesses, whether personal
or professional, that could be reasonably construed as a conflict of interest.
This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.
If, after this disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge the situation
and determine that it is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter
to serve in the case, the interpreter may interpret in the case.</P>

<P>The following are circumstances that are presumed to create actual or
perceived conflicts of interest for the interpreter where the interpreter
needs to declare the conflict of interest before appointment on the record
and let the court determine if the interpreter should serve in the case:</P>

<P>1.The interpreter is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or
counsel for a party involved in the proceedings;</P>

<P>2. The interpreter has served in an investigative capacity in the case
at issue for any party involved in the case;</P>

<P>3. The interpreter has previously been retained by a law enforcement
agency to assist in the preparation of the criminal case at issue;</P>

<P>4. The interpreter or the interpreter's spouse or child has a financial
interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding
or any other interest from which the interpreter may benefit from, that
would be affected by the outcome of the case;</P>

<P>5. The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law
firm for the case.</P>

<P>The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for
their services is contingent upon the outcome of the case.</P>

<P>An interpreter who is also an attorney should not serve as the court
or proceeding interpreter, as well as the attorney in the same case.</P>

<P>During the proceeding, the interpreter should avoid any conduct or behavior
that presents the appearance of favoritism toward any of the parties. The
Interpreter should maintain professional relationships with the non-English
speaking parties and witnesses, and should limit his or her involvement
in the proceedings to that of interpretation. The interpreter should discourage
a non-English speaking party's or witness' personal dependence on the interpreter.</P>

<P>The interpreter should refrain from conversations with parties, witnesses,
jurors, attorneys, or with friends or relatives of any party in or near
the courtroom, except in the discharge of their official functions. It
is especially important that the interpreter, who is often familiar with
attorneys or other members of the courtroom work group, including law enforcement
officers, refrain from casual and personal conversations with anyone in
the court that may convey an appearance of a special relationship or partiality
to any court participant.</P>

<P>An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's official
duties would be: communicating with the non-English speaking party or witness
in an informal setting where the interpreter would listen to accent, rhythm,
and the choice of words of the non-English speaking party to determine
if the interpreter can adequately interpret for the non-English speaking
party or witness. </P>

<P>The interpreter should strive for professional detachment. The interpreter
should avoid all verbal and nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices,
emotions, or opinions.</P>

<P>Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views
the interpreter as having a bias or being biased, the interpreter should
disclose that knowledge on the record to the judge and the parties in the
case. This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.
If all parties acknowledge the situation and determine that it is in the
best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the case, the
interpreter may continue to interpret in the case.</P>

<P><A NAME="4"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>4. IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT
OF INTEREST--INTERPRETER APPOINTED TO WORK WITH STATE-PAID, APPOINTED ATTORNEY</FONT></P>

<P>An interpreter appointed to work with a state-paid, appointed attorney
shall refrain from conduct that may give an appearance of personal bias
or conflict of interest. The interpreter so appointed may appear to have
the natural professional bias that occurs because the interpreter is part
of the appointed legal team. Interpreters appointed to work with an appointed
attorney shall disclose to the attorney any real bias or interest in the
parties or witnesses in a case, or any situation or relationship that may
be perceived by the court, any of the parties, or any witnesses as a personal
bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case. The appointed attorney
shall either petition the court for the appointment of a different interpreter
to the case, thereby releasing the interpreter from the interpreter's obligation
in the case, or the attorney shall bring the situation to the attention
of the court and opposing party, on the record. If the attorney fails to
bring the conflict to the attention of the court, the interpreter must
notify the court of a potential conflict of interest. This disclosure shall
not include privileged or confidential information. If all of the parties
agree that the interpreter may serve on the case, the interpreter may remain
appointed to the case. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Commentary</FONT></P>

<P>Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter
constitutes a conflict of interest. Before accepting appointment to a case,
the interpreter must disclose to all parties and the court any prior involvement
in the case or with the parties or witnesses, whether personal or professional,
that could be reasonably construed as a conflict of interest. This disclosure
shall not include privileged or confidential information. If, after this
disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge the situation and determine
that it is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve
in the case, the interpreter may interpret in the case.</P>

<P>The following are circumstances that are presumed to create actual or
perceived conflicts of interest for the interpreter where the interpreter
needs to declare the conflict of interest before appointment on the record
and let the court determine if the interpreter should serve in the case:</P>

<P>1. The interpreter is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or
counsel for a party involved in the proceedings;</P>

<P>2. The interpreter has served in an investigative capacity in the case
at issue for any party involved in the case;</P>

<P>3. The interpreter has previously been retained by a law enforcement
agency to assist in the preparation of the criminal case at issue;</P>

<P>4. The interpreter or the interpreter's spouse or child has a financial
interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding
or any other interest from which the interpreter may benefit from, that
would be affected by the outcome of the case;</P>

<P>5. The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law
firm for the case.</P>

<P>The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for
the interpreter's services is contingent upon the outcome of the case.</P>

<P>The interpreter appointed to work with an appointed attorney is to interpret
what is spoken by the non-English speaking party in private conferences
and conversations between the appointed attorney and the non-English speaking
party. In a case where the court has appointed the attorney and the interpreter,
the interpreter may also sit at the counsel table and interpret the proceeding
for the non-English speaking person in a simultaneous interpretation mode.
</P>

<P>An interpreter who is also an attorney may prepare a case without the
aid of an additional interpreter; however, it is not required. An attorney
who is also an interpreter may not act as the attorney and the interpreter
for the non-English speaking party in court during a proceeding.</P>

<P>Though appointed as a member of the legal team, the interpreter should
avoid any conduct or behavior that presents the appearance of any personal
favoritism toward any of the parties. The interpreter should maintain professional
relationships with the appointed attorney and the non-English speaking
party, and should limit their involvement with the non-English speaking
party to that of interpretation. The interpreter should discourage a non-English
speaking party's personal dependence on the interpreter and should defer
all questions the party may have to the appointed attorney. </P>

<P>Though a member of the appointed legal team, the interpreter must not
take on the role of advocate for the non-English speaking party. Despite
the fact that the interpreter is a member of the legal team, the interpreter
must still interpret everything that is said in court to the non-English
speaking party and to interpret everything that is said by the non-English
speaking party. For example, if in a criminal case the defendant becomes
angry during the proceeding and starts to shout obscenities at a witness
who is testifying, it is the interpreter's duty to interpret for the court
participants everything that the defendant is saying, even if what is being
said by the defendant is not helpful to the defense effort.</P>

<P>An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal,
investigative, or clerical work on the same case. The interpreter shall
not claim paralegal, investigative, or clerical work as interpretation
in any billings.</P>

<P>During the course of the proceedings, the interpreter should refrain
from conversations with parties, witnesses, jurors, attorneys, or with
friends or relatives of any party in or near the courtroom, except in the
discharge of their official functions. It is especially important that
the interpreter, who is often familiar with attorneys or other members
of the courtroom work group, including law enforcement officers, refrain
from casual and personal conversations with anyone in the court that may
convey an appearance of a special relationship or partiality to any of
the court participants other than that of the professional relationship
of interpreting for the appointed attorney and the non-English speaking
party.</P>

<P>An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's duties
would be: communicating with the non-English speaking party prior to appointment
to the case in an informal setting where the interpreter would listen to
accent, rhythm, and the choice of words of the non-English speaking party
to determine if the interpreter can adequately interpret for the non-English
speaking party. </P>

<P>The interpreter should strive for professional detachment. The interpreter
should avoid all verbal and nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices,
emotions, or opinions.</P>

<P>Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views
the interpreter as having a bias or being biased, the interpreter should
disclose that knowledge to the appointed attorney. The appointed attorney
shall either petition the court for the appointment of a different interpreter
to the case thereby releasing the interpreter from the interpreter's obligation
in the case, or the attorney shall bring the situation to the attention
of the court and opposing party, on the record. If the attorney fails to
bring the conflict to the attention of the court, the interpreter must
notify the court of a potential conflict of interest. This disclosure shall
not include privileged or confidential information. If all of the parties
agree that the interpreter may serve on the case, the interpreter may remain
on the case. </P>

<P><A NAME="5"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>5. PROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR</FONT></P>

<P>The interpreter shall conduct himself or herself in a manner consistent
with the dignity of the court and shall be as unobtrusive as possible.</P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+2>Commentary</FONT></H2>

<P>The interpreter should know and observe the established protocol, rules,
and procedures for delivering interpreting services. When speaking in English,
the interpreter should speak at a rate and volume that enables the interpreter
to be heard and understood throughout the courtroom, but the interpreter's
presence should otherwise be as unobtrusive as possible. The interpreter
should work without drawing undue or inappropriate attention to himself
or herself. The interpreter should dress in a manner that is consistent
with the dignity of the court proceedings. </P>

<P>The interpreter should avoid obstructing the view of any individual
involved in the proceeding. An interpreter who uses sign language or other
visual modes of communication must, however, be positioned so that the
sign language, facial expressions and whole body movement are visible to
the person for whom the interpreter is interpreting.</P>

<P>The interpreter is encouraged to avoid personal or professional conduct
that could discredit the court.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6"></A>6. CONFIDENTIALITY</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall understand the rules of privileged and other confidential
information and shall protect the confidentiality of all privileged and
other confidential information.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>The interpreter must protect and uphold the confidentiality of all privileged
information obtained during the course of his or her duties. It is especially
important that the interpreter understand and uphold the attorney-client
privilege that requires confidentiality with respect to any communication
between attorney and client. This rule also applies to other types of privileged
communications.</P>

<P>The interpreter must also refrain from repeating or disclosing case
information obtained by the interpreter in the course of employment.</P>

<P>In the event that the interpreter becomes aware of information that
suggests imminent harm to someone or relates to a crime being committed
during the course of the proceedings, the interpreter should immediately
disclose the information to the criminal presiding judge or a judge who
is not involved in the proceeding (if the presiding judge is involved in
the proceeding). At that point, it will become that judge's responsibility
to determine what action, if any, should be taken regarding the situation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="7"></A>7. RESTRICTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall not publicly discuss, report, or offer an opinion
concerning a matter in which the interpreter is or has been engaged, even
when that information is not privileged or required by law to be confidential.</P>

<H2><A NAME="8"></A>8. SCOPE OF PRACTICE</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall limit himself or herself to interpreting or performing
sight translating and shall not give legal advice, express personal opinions
to individuals for whom the interpreter is interpreting, or engage in any
other activities that may be construed to constitute a service other than
interpreting or translating.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>Because the interpreter is responsible only for enabling others to communicate,
the interpreter should limit himself or herself to the activity of interpreting
or translating only. The interpreter should refrain from initiating communications
while interpreting unless it is necessary for assuring an accurate and
faithful interpretation.</P>

<P>The interpreter may be required to initiate communications during a
proceeding when they find it necessary to seek assistance in performing
his or her duties. Examples of such circumstances include seeking direction
when unable to understand or express a word or thought, requesting speakers
to moderate their rate of communication or repeat or rephrase something,
correcting the interpreter's own interpreting errors, or notifying the
court of reservations about his or her ability to satisfy an assignment
competently. In such instances, the interpreter should make it clear that
the interpreter is speaking for himself or herself.</P>

<P>The interpreter may convey legal advice only when the interpreter is
interpreting legal advice that an attorney is giving. The interpreter should
not explain the purpose of forms, services, or otherwise act as a counselor
or advisor unless the interpreter is interpreting for someone who is acting
in that official capacity.</P>

<P>The interpreter should not personally perform acts that are the official
responsibility of other court officials, including, but not limited to,
court clerks, pretrial release investigators, indigence verification specialists,
or probation counselors.</P>

<P>An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal,
investigative, or clerical work on the same case. The interpreter shall
not claim paralegal, investigative, or clerical work as interpretation
in any billings.</P>

<H2><A NAME="9"></A>9. ASSESSING AND REPORTING IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMANCE</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall assess at all times his or her ability to deliver
interpretation services. When the interpreter has any reservation about
his or her ability to satisfy an assignment competently, the interpreter
shall immediately convey that reservation to the court.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>If the communication mode or language of the non-English speaking person
cannot be readily interpreted or becomes difficult to readily interpret,
the interpreter should notify the court immediately.</P>

<P>The interpreter should notify the court of any environmental or physical
limitation that impedes or hinders the interpreter's ability to deliver
interpreting services adequately, e.g., the courtroom is not quiet enough
for the interpreter to hear or be heard by the non-English speaker, more
than one person at a time is speaking, or principals or witnesses of the
court are speaking at a rate of speed that is too rapid for the interpreter
to adequately interpret. A sign language interpreter must ensure that he
or she can both see and convey the full range of visual language elements
that are necessary for communication, including facial expressions and
body movement, as well as sign language.</P>

<P>The interpreter should notify the court of the need to take periodic
breaks in order to maintain mental and physical alertness and to prevent
interpreter fatigue. The interpreter should recommend and encourage the
court to use more than one interpreter in a lengthy proceeding or trial.</P>

<P>Even a competent and experienced interpreter may encounter cases where
routine proceedings suddenly involve technical or specialized terminology
unfamiliar to the interpreter, e.g., the unscheduled testimony of an expert
witness. When such instances occur, the interpreter should request a brief
recess in order to familiarize himself or herself with the subject matter.
If familiarity with the terminology requires extensive time or more intensive
research, the interpreter should inform the judge.</P>

<P>The interpreter is encouraged to make inquiries as to the nature of
a case whenever possible before accepting an assignment. This enables the
interpreter to more closely match his or her professional qualifications,
skills, and experience to potential assignments, and more accurately assess
the interpreter's ability to competently satisfy those assignments.</P>

<P>The interpreter should refrain from accepting a case if the interpreter
feels the language and subject matter of that case may exceed his or her
skills or capacities. The interpreter should feel no compunction about
notifying the court if the interpreter feels unable to perform competently
due to lack of familiarity with terminology, preparation or difficulty
in understanding a witness or defendant.</P>

<P>The interpreter should notify the presiding officer of any personal
bias he or she may have involving any aspect of the proceedings, including
any bias as to the subject matter of the case, or bias against any of the
parties in the case.</P>

<H2><A NAME="10"></A>10. DUTY TO REPORT ETHICAL VIOLATIONS</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall report to the court any actions by any persons
that may impede the interpreter's compliance with any law, any provision
of this code, or any other official policy governing court interpreting
and sight translating.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>Because the users of interpreting services frequently misunderstand
the proper role of the interpreter, they may ask or expect the interpreter
to perform duties or engage in activities that run counter to the provisions
of this code or other laws, regulations, or policies governing court interpreters.
It is incumbent upon the interpreter to inform such persons of his or her
professional obligations. If, having been apprised of these obligations,
the person persists in demanding that the interpreter violate them, the
interpreter should turn to the court's interpreter coordinator, the trial
court administrator or trial court clerk, or the judge to resolve the situation.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="11"></A>11. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</H2>

<P>The interpreter shall continually improve his or her skills and knowledge
and advance the profession through activities such as professional training
and education and interaction with colleagues and specialists in related
fields.</P>

<H3>Commentary</H3>

<P>The interpreter must continually strive to increase his or her knowledge
of the languages in which the interpreter works professionally, including
past and current trends in technical, vernacular, and regional terminology,
as well as their application within court proceedings.</P>

<P>The interpreter should keep informed of all statutes, rules of courts,
and policies of the judiciary that relate to the performance of the interpreter's
professional duties.</P>

<P>The interpreter should seek to elevate the standards of the profession
through participation in workshops, professional meetings, interaction
with colleagues, and reading current literature in the field.</P>
