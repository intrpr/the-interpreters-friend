<P>I am one of those interpreters who advocates plain clothing (contrasting
with skin color), solid-color, non-dangling earrings, no patterned
scarves to &quot;break up the monotony&quot; or &quot;express my personality,&quot; etc.  I believe interpreters should wear business attire in business setting, and dress in a style that is compatible with that of the teachers, presenters, office workers, exercise instructors, etc., with whom we
work.

<P>I do this because I have been honored with the honesty of some deaf people who say interpreter dress *is* important - and that while it may not matter as much to some deaf people, it matters a whole lot to many deaf people who don't feel as though they can honestly tell interpreters what they prefer or who fear the interpreters' reactions to such a request.  (I recently facilitated a workshop for Deaf Community members in another state on how to get what you want from interpreters.  Guess what one of the issues was?  Yep, dress.)

<P>When I teach, play, party, study, and sleep, I wear - or don't wear (!) - whatever I want because that time is mine.  When I'm working, I dress appropriately for the setting out of respect for the consumers involved.

<P>I just went back to my saved messages and retrieved a message that I posted to the list on December 15.  At that time, the subject was &quot;Professional Attire.&quot;

<P>Here's what I said in December -- and since I still agree with myself, I
thought I'd rekindle that deja vu kinda feeling.

<P>I would like to add one thought to the professional dress issue.

<P>I don't know what it's like in other states, but in Minnesota (my home for sixteen years) and in Oregon (starting my can-you-believe-it sixth year here) when Deaf consumers were asked to provide feedback on their intepreters, the number one complaint was about interpreter dress. Again.  And again.

<P>I'd really like us to get this one behind us - as a group - so that Deaf
people could:

<P>1) have clear access to visual information against  the skin-contrasting, plain, non-distracting &quot;background&quot; of our clothing,
<BR>2) see that we respect our consumers by dressing in a manner appropriate
to the situation,
<BR>3) believe that we listen to their feedback by paying attention to our dress, and
<BR>4) stop having to focus on dress and feel welcomed to provide other
kinds of input about our service.

<P>This is an easy one to accomplish - and if we could do that, we could show consumers that we respect our position in their community and in our profession - and move on to the hard stuff.

<P>Good things *do* come in plain packages --  :)
