<P>This from a book about differences that arise between Native and non-Native
healers that looks at race, gender &amp; community. Thought it useful
in terms of interpreter-to-interpreter relations:

<DIR>

<P>Dances of ego are nothing new.  Gossip as a form of peer review
performs a useful function until it enters the realm where words become
poison instead of antidote. Criticism may arise from and serve connectedness--mutual effort and excellence--or it may distance and compete for ascendancy.

<P>It is frustrating to hear pettiness endlessly bandied about, then note
how the ranks close in collective denial about vital issues.   To be silent
or to squabble when mature communication is needed is to succumb to a loss
of perspective.

<P>How can the community serve the well-being of others if practitioners
become too caught up in their positions in the elite hierarchy to attend
to their work? How can practitioners develop and learn if they are
preoccupied with trying to appear infallible? One misstep and enemies
close in. Relax your guard and be blindsided.

<P>Shortcuts tempt the beleaguered, and ethics take a beating.
This is not the whole picture, of course, but it is an accurate sketch
of one part of it.

<P>There are productive ways of dealing with one another about differences.
Sometimes a misunderstanding seems almost deliberate--it is easier to write
each other off than to make efforts to reach tolerance, if not agreement.
If we do not make the effort, we become poor examples. We become more
and more locked into our individual positions. Elitism, one-upmanship,
racial and gender issues, factionalism, pride, argument over technicalities,
and lack of trust or openness are banes of the community. Positive
elements include stimulus for growth [and] reduction of characteristic isolation. For the community to flourish, these positive elements need to emerge, not just coincidentally, but through active nurturance whatever our
differences, the core of commitment should preempt lesser alignments.

shamans on race, gender, and community.</I> (1995)

<P>Peace!
