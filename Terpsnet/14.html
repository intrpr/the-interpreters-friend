<P>GR 11.1

<P>CODE OF CONDUCT FOR COURT INTERPRETERS

<P>PREAMBLE. All language interpreters serving in a legal proceeding,
whether certified or uncertified, shall abide by the following Code of
Conduct:

<P>A language interpreter who violates any of the provisions of this code
is subject to a citation for contempt, disciplinary action or any other
sanction that may be imposed by law. The purpose of this Code of
Conduct is to establish and maintain high standards of conduct to preserve
the integrity and independence of the adjudicative system.

<P>(a) A language interpreter, like an officer of the court, shall maintain
high stands of personal and professional conduct that promote public confidence
in the administration of justice.
<P>(b) A language interpreter shall interpret or translate the material
thoroughly and precisely, adding or omitting nothing, and stating as nearly
as possible what has been stated in the language of the speaker,
<BR>giving consideration to variations in grammar an syntax for both lnaguage
involved. A language interpreter shall use the level of communication
that best conveys the meaning of the source, and shall not interject the
interpreter's personal moods or attitudes.
<BR>
<BR>(c) When a language interpreter has any reservation about ability
to satisfy an assignment competently, the interpreter shall immediately
convey that reservation to the parties and to the court. If the communicaton
mode or language of the non-English speaking person cannot be readily interpreted,
the interpreter shall notify the appointing authority or the court.

<P>(d) No language interpreter shall render services in any matter in
which the interpreter is a potential witness, associate, friend, or relative
of a contending party, unless a specific exception is allowed by the appointing
authority for good cause noted on the record. Neither shall the interpreter
serve in any matter in which the interpreter has an interest, financial
or otherwise, in the outcome. Nor shall any language interpreter
serve in a matter where the interpreter has participated in the choice of counsel.

<P>(e) Except in the interpreter's official capacity, no language interpreter
shall discuss, report, or comment upon a matter in which the person serves
as interpreter. Interpreters shall not disclose any communication
that is privileged by law without the written consent of the parties to
the communication, or pursuant to court order.

<P>(f) A language interpreter shall report immediately to the appointing
authority in the proceeding any solicitation or effort by another to induce
or encourage the interpreter to violate any law, any provision of the rules
which may be apporved by the courts for the practice of language interpreting,
or any provisions of this Code of Conduct.

<P>(g) Language interpreters shall not give legal advice and shall refrain
from the unauthorized practice of law.
