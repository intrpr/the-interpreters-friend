<P>January 27, 1997</P>

<P>Dear Ms. Pelegrin:</P>

<P>I would like to thank you for your presentation at the recent Workshop
for Federal Court Interpreters that the Federal Judicial Center hosted
in Albuquerque. You did an admirable job of facing an audience of angry
and frustrated interpreters who feel that your office is not doing enough
to remedy the serious problems that affect interpreting services in the
federal courts. I believe it became evident to most of us that there is
nothing to be gained by continuing to berate you, and that we must seek
other avenues through which to address our problems while continuing to
maintain communication with your office.</P>

<P>At the same time, I would like to reiterate NAJIT's position on compensation
for contract interpreters. As you are aware, the Court Interpreters Advisory
Subgroup has decided--according to the minutes of its December 13 teleconference--that
there is &quot;no need&quot; for an increase in the per diem rate, which
has remained at the same level since March 1991. (I serve on the Subgroup,
but was unable to attend that meeting because I was in court.) The reason
cited was that few courts report difficulty in finding contract interpreters
willing to accept that rate of remuneration. The short-sighted, one-sided
logic underlying the pronouncement that there is &quot;no need&quot; for
an increase makes it painfully clear that the so-called Court Interpreters
Advisory Subgroup does not represent the interests of interpreters. I assume
that the moral argument that an increase is the right thing to do for a
hard-working group of professionals carries no weight at all. I likewise
assume that you would dismiss as irrelevant the point that if it were the
Subgroup members' income that had been frozen for the past six years, they
would surely disagree with the assertion that there was &quot;no need&quot;
for a raise. I would therefore cite just one of the many compelling arguments
in favor of recommending an increase: compensation is a vital component
of working conditions, and if eroding wages make these conditions untenable,
the overall pool of interpreting talent will be diminished as interpreters
leave the field, to the detriment of the quantity and quality of the contract
workforce, and to the interests of justice served thereby.</P>

<P>NAJIT condemns the Subgroup's decision in the strongest possible terms.</P>

<P>Respectfully,</P>

<P>David Mintz Chair, NAJIT Board of Directors</P>
