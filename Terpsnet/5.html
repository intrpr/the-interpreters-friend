<P>The following code is taken from Court Interpretation:
Model Guides for Policy and Practice in the State Courts, by William E.
Hewitt and staff, State Justice Institute. Publication Number: R-167 ISBN:0-89656-146-1

<P>There are currently eight states which have adopted these canons (or
slight variations thereof). They are: Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Utah and (sorry, I can't remember the last
onehttp://www.theinterpretersfriend.com.it might be Virginia) Additionally, California is currently discussing
the possibility of modifying its code to include all ten of these canons.
There is a commentary following each of the canons in the Model Guides
book which explains each of them more completely.</P>

<P><B>Canon 1: ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS </B></P>

<P>Interpreters shall accurately and completely represent their certification,
training, and pertinent experience. </P>

<P><B>Canon 3: IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST </B></P>

other confidential information. </P>

<P><B>Canon 6: RESTRICTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT</B></P>

<P><B>Canon 7: SCOPE OF PRACTICE</B></P>

<P>Interpreters shall limit themselves to interpreting or translating,
and shall not give legal advice, express personal opinions to individuals

while serving as an interpreter. </P>

<P><B>Canon 8: ASSESSING AND REPORTING IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMANCE</B></P>

to the appropriate judicial authority. </P>

<P>Interpreters shall continually improve their skills and knowledge and
advance the profession through activities such as professional training
and education, and interaction with colleagues and specialists in related
fields.</P>
