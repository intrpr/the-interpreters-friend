<P>A colleague who had not attended the Allies conferences
wrote, saying he did not understand this "Allies business" it seems
like just an updated version of the old helper model," and asked if I could
explain what I had learned about the ally model. This was my reply:
<HR>

<P>Dear Colleague;

<P>First, just to give the usual caveats. I don't hold myself up in any
fashion as qualified to give a definitive view of this ally vs. advocate
vs. helper issue.  More than anything I realize how much I *don't* know,
and realize that what I understand to be true may indeed be false and guided
by my own understanding of the world, solely, rather than that of others.
There may be others on the list who are far more credentialled, in life
as well as more formally, to respond to this question.&nbsp; So, with that
in mind, let me ramble a bit on this issue and see what surfaces.

<P>You called it "this Allies business".&nbsp; I like that, because I think
it's misguided in some ways to call it a model, as if there were some set
of guidelines that one could follow and thus be a more effective interpreter.&nbsp;
In regard to the term itself, it's not without controversy.&nbsp; During
the first evening of the 2nd Allies meeting in Nashua, there was much frank
talk about whether the term was appropriate.&nbsp; Deaf people, in particular,
found it somewhat suspect.&nbsp; Harkening back to their high school classes
and lessons of WWII, they didn't quite see the relationship between what
essentially were treaty-like arrangements between sovereign nations, and
the relationship that interpreters and the Deaf community were trying to
address.

<P>They also--as they have time and again--railed about hearing folks (in
this case, interpreters) inventing a term without regard for what Deaf
people feel about it.&nbsp; A subtle means by which the colonizer controls
the colonized.&nbsp; And even more pointedly, one Deaf man, Alec Naiman
from NY, stood up and said (loose translation here), "The Americans and
French were Allies during the war.&nbsp; American soldiers went to Europe
to die alongside Frenchmen on the battlefields.&nbsp; If you are, as you
say, our *allies*, are you willing to, or do you, die beside us?&nbsp;
Deaf people are dying on 'battlefields' every day!"

<P>As the weekend progressed, more often than not people referred to this
"Allies business" as the x factor, that quality by which Deaf people defined
the good, or skillful interpreter, the preferred interpreter, the person
who has earned their trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we struggled to come to some
definition of what that was, without ever really achieving a comprehensive
sense of such a characteristic.&nbsp; One thing that has remained with
me--and helps me distinguish this quality from those we consider to describe
the *helper*--was an openness to the concept of at all times recognizing
opportunities for Deaf people, individually and as a community, to take
the lead in decisionmaking about the course of their lives. to walk behind
or beside rather than grasping control at every instance and defining the
situation and its results, subtly or overtly, for them.

<P>Still, there are ways to reconcile this English word--allies--or the
concept behind it, with what I believe Deaf people wish us to be.&nbsp;
An alliance, my dictionary says, is a relationship by union of qualities,
an affinity or kinship marked by community of interest.&nbsp; So, if I
wish to ally myself to any group, it makes sense that I would have common
interests and common qualities as that group, even if I may not necessarily
qualify as a member.&nbsp; Certainly one would hope that this were true
of interpreters vis a vis Deaf people.&nbsp; At the same Allies conference,
Deaf people and Codas asked us, "Why are you here?&nbsp; Why are you associating
among the members of this community?"

<P>It is a question that is plain, yet complex all at once.&nbsp; Because
it asks us to be straightforward about our intentions.&nbsp; If we intend
to be more than allies in word, then shouldn't our actions, our beliefs,
and our understanding be informed by the same language, manner, social
norms, and visual perception of the world as theirs?&nbsp; Impossible on
the one hand because we are raised hearing, yet still possible to more
closely embrace than we have.&nbsp; And this sort of affinity, if you will,
is directly in conflict with the helper model, which presupposes an incapacity
at some level that must be "helped".&nbsp; Many of the motives that have
led people --non-native and "strangers" to the community-- to become interpreters
have been founded upon a corrupt vision of who Deaf people are, and a dismissal
of their capabilities as equal partners in life and society.&nbsp; So Deaf
people challenge our position and role in their lives, because so often
our relationship to the community is, at the least, misguided, and at worst,
dysfunctional from their point of view.

<P>If we are to ally ourselves to ASL users and their community in a more
positive fashion, then it means a more functional, humane and interpersonal
relationship--not a relationship defined from a medical or provider/client
perspective.&nbsp; It means more than lip service to the idea that ASL
is a legitimate language derived from a legitimate culture, and a true
acceptance that the Deaf world and way of life is equally as valid as is
our own.&nbsp; The machine model and telephone/bridge-type metaphors overlooked
the intimate link between a language and its culture, partly due to the
fact that hearing people overlooked the fact that a culture existed.&nbsp;
I agree when Betty Colonomos says that such an approach or model was deficient
because it actually was too focused on product, without recognizing the
dynamics of interpersonal communication, and particularly cross-cultural
communication between two communities that are not functioning on an even
playing field.&nbsp; It was thought that if one could spit out the signs,
or the English words while interpreting, that the deed was done and we
could walk away from the job satisfied that we had done some good.&nbsp;
And yet, and yet. Deaf people were (and still are) "dying on the battlefields".

<P>With a better understanding of Deaf culture and what it entails, we
realize that it is only when we navigate the Deaf World with an open heart
and great respect that we begin to develop real relationships and connections
to that community.&nbsp; It is then that we truly begin to bridge the distances
between our respective cultures' difference, and approximate the language
use necessary to be an effective and respected interpreter to Deaf people.&nbsp;
I believe that the way we fashioned the practice of our profession has
thrown real obstacles to becoming skillful users of ASL and "mediators"
between the two cultures.&nbsp; It is only through allying ourselves, through
developing a true affinity, that we can nurture that "x factor" so necessary
to be successful.

<P>Culture and language are rivers, ever changing &amp; flowing. a dynamic
process expressed by their communities' users.&nbsp; Standing outside,
and offering help. being merely a link, or piece of machinery. these
things keep us separate.&nbsp; And, to me, separateness clouds our understanding.&nbsp;
To effectively flow with the river, we must jump in, and try our best to
swim.&nbsp; Because we are not native to the river, we'll make our mistakes,
fight the current, get stuck in a snag or swept to the sandbars near the
banks.&nbsp; There is also the danger of immersing oneself and drowning.&nbsp;
But if we trust in the river to hold us up and guide us downstream, we
just might have the good fortune to glide along.&nbsp; And that's what
I'm hoping and trying to do.

<P>Does that help??

<P>Tim K.
