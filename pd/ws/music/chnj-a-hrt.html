<P>Every dreamer has dreamed of a perfect life
<BR>I know the world has been trying for years to get it right
<BR>We try and try, but find it impossible to do
<BR>Don't you wish we could make this a better place
<BR>Can't you see that we must live life a different way.
<BR>Every day, imagine what love could turn this to.
<BR>Wanna change the world, then change your mind.
<BR>We'll light the darkness one life at a time

<P><B>Chorus</B>: When we change a heart, we change the world.
<BR>A spark of love can turn into a fire bright as the sun,
<BR>If you change a heart today.
<BR>Then that could change a million tomorrows.
<BR>What started as a whisper will echo on and on
<BR>When we change a heart, we change the world.

<P>A voice is waking a heart to the light of day
<BR>A tiny flicker of hope can push the night away
<BR>It's safe to say a caring heart brings another back
<BR>Can you fathom a world where we open up
<BR>Can you picture the day we've all been dreaming of
<BR>Live and love like right now is all we really have
<BR>Wanna change the world, then change your mind
<BR>We'll find forever one day at a time.

<P>[Not included in this clip: <B>Chorus</B>
<BR>You may think it's crazy
<BR>But that's alright with me
<BR>It's gonna take some time to find the way
<BR>But I believe... <B>Chorus</B>]
