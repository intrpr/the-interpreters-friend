<PRE>1. I danced in the morning when the world was begun,






And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,






And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth,






At Bethlehem I had my birth.






REFRAIN: Dance, then, wherever you may be;






For I am the Lord of the Dance, said he.






And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,






And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he. [end of refrain]






2. I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,






But they would'nt dance and they wouldn't follow me;






I danced for the fishermen, for James and John;






They came to me and the dance went on. REFRAIN






3. I danced on the sabbath and I cured the lame,






The holy people said it was a shame;






They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high;






And they left me there on a cross to die. [no refrain]






4. I danced on a Friday and the sky turned black;






It's hard to dance with the world on your back;






They buried my body and they thought I'd gone,






But I am the dance and I still go on. REFRAIN






5. They cut me down and I leapt up high,






I am the life that'll never, never die;






I'll live in you if you'll live in me;






I am the Lord of the Dance, said he. REFRAIN
