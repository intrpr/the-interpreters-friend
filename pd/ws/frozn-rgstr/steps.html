<PRE>
<P>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become <BR>unmanageable.








<P>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to <BR>sanity. 








<P>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of G-d as <BR>we understood Him. 








<P>4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 








<P>5. Admitted to G-d, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact <BR>nature of our wrongs. 








<P>6. Were entirely ready to have G-d remove all these defects of character. 








<P>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 








<P>8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make <BR>amends to them all. 








<P>9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so <BR>would injure them or others. 








<P>10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly <BR>admitted it. 








<P>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact <BR>with G-d as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for <BR>us and the power to carry that out. 








<P>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried <BR>to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in <BR>all our affairs.
