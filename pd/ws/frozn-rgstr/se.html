<BR>good deeds of loving-kindness

<BR>kindness of our forefathers,

<BR>Abraham.









<P>You are great forever my L-rd, You revive the dead, with great 
<BR>salvation.

<BR>of Hosts; the fullness of the whole earth is G-d¹s glory! 









<P>Source of our strength, how majestic is Your presence in all the earth! <BR>Blessed is the glory of L-rd in G-d¹s place.
