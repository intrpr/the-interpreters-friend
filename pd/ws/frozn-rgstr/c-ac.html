<PRE><P>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: 



And in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord; 



who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, 



suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; 



he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; 



he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father  



Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.



I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic church; 



the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; 



the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen
