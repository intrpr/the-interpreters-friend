<PRE>1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon <BR>A.A. unity. 







2. For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authority--a loving God <BR>as he may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but <BR>trusted servants; they do not govern. 









3. The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking. 








4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups <BR>of A.A. as a whole. 








5. Each group has but one primary purpose--to carry its message to the <BR>alcoholic who still suffers. 







6. An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any <BR>related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property <BR>and prestige divert us from our primary purpose. 









7. Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside <BR>contributions. 







8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our <BR>service centers may employ special workers. 







9. A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards <BR>or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 







10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. <BR>name ought never be drawn into public controversy. 







11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than <BR>promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of <BR>press, radio and films. 









12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever <BR>reminding us to place principles before personalities.
