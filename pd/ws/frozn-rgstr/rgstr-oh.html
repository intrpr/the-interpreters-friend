<H2><P>Formal:	Please come into the examining room, Mr. Smith.  If you will step up onto the scale, I would like to get your weight.

<P>Consultative: Come into the room here, Mr. Smith.  How much do you weigh?. . .  O.K. Please step on the scales and I'll check that.  Oh, I see here that you are 5 pounds heavier.  Maybe your scales at home are light.

<P>Casual: So, John, come in and we'll see how much you're weighing today.  Boy I bet those kids of yours have grown a lot. . . . Yeah, there just at that age. . . .  OK.  You're 162 pounds on the nose.

<P>Intimate:  John, we're lookin' like you put on weight.  Let's check you out.  Now, don't be shy.  Step up there.  Yep.  I'm right; up 12.  Margaret's not gunna be very happy with you.  You'll have to tell her to quit making that sorbet you like so well.  You let her pamper you too much.</H2>
