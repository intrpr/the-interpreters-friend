Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.









Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.









And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
<BR>soul and with all your might.









And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart.









And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and you shall speak of <BR>them when you sit at home, and when you walk along the way, and when you <BR>lie down and when you rise up.












And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets <BR>between your eyes.









And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.









And it shall come to pass if you surely listen to the commandments that I <BR>command you today, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all <BR>your heart and all your soul, that I will give rain to your land, the early <BR>and the late rains, that you may gather in your grain, your wine and your oil.















And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle and you will eat and you <BR>will be satisfied.









Beware, lest your heart be decieved, and you turn and serve other Gods, and <BR>worship them.









And anger of the Lord will blaze against you, and he will close the heavens
<BR>and there will not be rain, and the earth will not give you its fullness, <BR>and you will perish quickly from the good land that the Lord gives you.













So you shall put these, my words, on your heart and on your soul; and you shall <BR>bind them for signs on your hands, and they shall be for frontlets between <BR>your eyes.













And you shall teach them to your children, and you shall speak of them when you <BR>sit in your house, and when you walk on the way, and when you lie down, and <BR>when you rise up.













And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.









In order to prolong your days and the days of your children on the land that <BR>the Lord promised your fathers that he would give them, as long as the days <BR>that the heavens are over the earth.













And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying "Speak to the children of Israel and say to <BR>them, they should make themselves tzitzit (fringes) on the corners of their <BR>clothing throughout their generations, and give the tzitzit of each corner <BR>a thread of blue.













And they shall be tzitzit for you, and when you look at them you will remember <BR>all of the Lord's commandments and do them and not follow after your heart <BR>and after your eyes, which lead you astray.













In order to remember and do all My commandments, and be holy for your God.









I am the Lord, your God, who lead you from the land of Egypt to be a God to <BR>you. I am the Lord, your God.
