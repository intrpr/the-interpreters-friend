<P>1. Interpreters/Transliterators may discuss assignment-related information only with other teachers and supervisors who are directly responsible for the educational program of the deaf/Hard of Hearing children for whom the interpreter interprets/transliterates.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: Interpreters/Transliterators at the elementary and secondary levels are often assuming the primary role of interpreter and tutor. In this capacity the interpreter/transliterator functions as a support service provider on the educational team who answers directly to the teachers who are responsible for the child's functioning in the interpreting situation on a regular basis with the supervising teachers and/or designated administration.

<P>2. Interpreters/Transliterators shall render the message faithfully, always conveying the content and spirit of the speaker, using language most readily understood by the person(s) whom they serve.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: It is the interpreters'/transliterators' responsibility to transmit the message as it was intended. Short clarifications of presented material may be done throughout the presentation; but if explanation is required, this should be done at a later time, by the classroom teacher or the interpreter/transliterator. When interpreting/transliterating from spoken English to sign, the educational Interpreter will communicate in the manner most easily understood by the student(s). When working from sign to spoken language, the interpreter will speak the language used by the hearing person.

<P>3. Under the direction of the subject area teacher, the interpreter/transliterator may tutor deaf/hard of hearing students and assist them to better comprehend the presented material. The interpreter should direct students to an appropriate person for the advice they seek.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: In the educational setting the interpreter often assumes the dual role of interpreter/tutor. The interpreter is to interpret the message faithfully during the actual interpreted sessions but she/he may tutor and assist after the interpreting sessions have been completed. Exactly what is to be done and how tutoring is to occur will be at the discretion of the classroom teacher. The interpreter/transliterator will direct their activities depending on the classroom teacher's directions and the teaching materials the teacher provides the interpreter to use while tutoring. The interpreter will not be required to devise teaching materials or follow-up activities for deaf/hard of hearing students without input from the classroom teacher.

<P>4. Interpreters/Transliterators in the educational setting shall accept employment for which they are qualified, based on their certification level on the RID evaluation, QA screening or the Florida Educational Evaluation.

<P>5. Interpreters/Transliterators shall request compensation for services in a professional and judicious manner, according tot he level of certification achieved on the RID evaluation, QA Screenings or the Florida Educational Interpreter Evaluation.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: School districts are encouraged to establish salary schedules for educational interpreters/transliterators based on their achieved certification levels on the RID Evaluation, QA Screening or the Florida Educational Interpreter Evaluation. Salary increments should be built into these schedules based on years of service and higher certification levels achieved.

<P>6. Interpreters/Transliterators shall function in a manner appropriate to the situation.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: In the educational setting, it is vital that the interpreters/transliterators conduct themselves in a professional manner reflective of the other professionals working in the schools. The interpreter/transliterator should seek the respect of the students and other school professionals and should at all times display professional conduct and modes of dress. The interpreter/transliterator should wear clothing befitting the interpreting situation, which is in contrast to skin tones, and which is not distracting to the conveyance of the signed message. The interpreter's personal conduct should demonstrate willingness to be part of the educational team and should display behaviors, which are cooperative and supportive in spirit. The interpreter/transliterator should not allow themselves to be placed in an adversarial role, and should resolve controversial issues as cooperating member of the team.

<P>7. Interpreters/Transliterators shall accept the same responsibility and authority as other members of the educational staff. They will abide by and enforce federal, state, school district and individual school laws and rules.
<I>Guidelines</I>: As school district employees, interpreters/transliterators must assume the responsibility of knowing and enforcing governmental and school laws. As a working member of the educational team, the interpreter/transliterator is not exempt from the codes and policies established by the educational agency. Participation as an educational team member requires that interpreters/transliterators help enforce these rules and report infringements of laws, rules and codes to the appropriate authority. Students should be informed that violation of laws and rules will be reported to appropriate authorities.

<P>8. Interpreters/Transliterators shall strive to further knowledge and skills through participation in workshops, professional meetings, and interaction with professional colleagues and reading of current literature in the field.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: Interpreters/transliterators in the educational setting should assume personal responsibility for the improvement of their skills. Though School systems may offer some inservice training; the burden of skill improvement rests primarily with the interpreters themselves. School systems often have limited funds and are not willing to pay travel expenses or tuition costs for extending training. Interpreters/transliterators should recognize that this is the case and that they may have to rely on the use of personal resources for professional development.

<P>9. Interpreters/Transliterators are encouraged to hold membership in local, state and national interpreting organizations, and should strive to maintain high professional standards in compliance with the educational interpreter code of ethics.
<BR><I>Guidelines</I>: Interpreters/transliterators in the educational setting should consider themselves as important members of the interpreting community. As such they should obtain membership in interpreting organizations at all levels and should actively participate in the functioning of the organization and the structuring of its goals to meet the needs of the educational interpreters/transliterators.
