The data was collected via standardized case presentations and rating forms distributed to individuals who were non-randomly selected, with anonymity protected in all phases of research. ANOVAs were performed in comparing Lichert Scale answers to the rating form items between and within the two populations.  Results indicate differences between groups in self-perception, perception of others, identity, and global attitudes. Many of these disparities can be attributed to socio-cultural norms, differences between attributes afforded by cultural backgrounds, as well as established hierarchies of interpersonal and intrapersonal identity expression, with clear definition along boundaries according to sexual orientation. Heterosexual individuals displayed, in general, more positive attitudes and perceptions than homosexual interpreters towards the homosexual interpreter.

The conversation speed may be too fast to accurately indicate which character is speaking at a give time.  Mannerisms are instrumental in conveying the complete message and the personality, attitude, or state of mind of the speaker.

Excerpt: Speech pathology assessments place considerable linguistic and ethical demands on interpreters. Often interpreters are asked to analyze a patient's responses, in order to identify deviations from the language norms of the patient's community which might lead to a diagnosis of a speech or language impairment. This situation creates considerable confusion over roles and responsibilities for speech pathologists and interpreters. The author outlines the features of this complex context, focuses on the degree to which there is a shared understanding of respective professional roles, and makes recommendations regarding future collaboration and research.

Excerpt: This paper describes some of the difficulties faced in enabling public service organizations to recognize their responsiblities when working through an interpreter. It highlights the crucial communicative role played by the Service Provider, and urges a process model of in-service training. While recognizing that Police Officers, Social Workers and Probation Officers are all working in different environments and may have conflicting agendas, the model can be adapted to suit each context provided that five main principles are observed. The five principles are described, as is the format for putting them into practice. Service Provider responses to the activities are summarized. The paper concludes that becoming skilled in providing a service to non-English speaking service users is to provide a better service to all, whether English speaking or not.

Excerpt: In the mid seventies, the Danish Ministry for Social Affairs opened a so-called 'hot-line' manned by 4 phone interpreters. Over the years it became obvious that the existing interpretation services were not sufficient and needed improving. Thus, the first training programme was launched at the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) in 1985, followed by five other programmes from 1988-1990, and finally in 1996 a more comprehensive training programme was initiated by the CBS and the Aarhus School of Business (ASB). The paper gives a short overreview of the general interpreter training situation in Denmark. Then, it discusses the community interpreter training situation focussing on the new programme and giving a description of the curriculum and the ideas behind it.

Excerpt: In Quebec, only Court interpreters are certified by the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interpr&egrave;tes agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec. However, the other branches of Community Interpretation in settings such as health care or education are not recognized by the Ordre. It can be difficult for an interpreter, not accepted by his peers, to demonstrate his expertise to other professionals. Using a questionnaire addressed to doctors, social workers, etc., and my own experience, especially in ethnopsychiatry, we will see that community interpreters have the necessary skills to become members of a professional order. As such, they will be officially considered as the full-fledged professionals that they have always been.

Excerpt: Ireland used to be a country of net emigration but over the last decade there has been a steady increase in immigration by asylum seekers and by workers from the European Economic Area and from outside Europe. There has been a rapid change from an exclusively English speaking country to a multilingual one with up to a hundred languages being spoken. Clearly this presents particular problems when non-English speakers are in contact with officialdom. Interpreting is provided in the courts, in police stations, in hospitals and over the phone for doctors. But the interpreters receive absolutely no training in interpreting. They are not tested and there is no forum where they can receive guidance on ethical issues. The official attitude is that these foreigners will learn English and will no longer need interpretation. The discussion will focus on what can be done to increase awareness of the issues surrounding Community Interpreting?

Excerpt: This paper will provide an overview of the evolution of language services in Australia, which has a unique national testing system (NAATI ) for the accreditation of translators, interpreters and language aides. The testing format, levels of accreditation, languages tested, language panels and a brief history of NAATI will be explained. Various government departments have been pro-active in developing language services policies which will be highlighted. Efforts to ensure policies are implemented at the grassroots level will be outlined. Attempts to provide language services to our indigenous population will also be discussed. Does this mean that social justice is enjoyed by all? No! What are the barriers we still need to overcome and what are the steps necessary to ensure equity of access becomes a reality for all Australians?

Excerpt: Community interpreters are the first to be concerned about the development of their profession. They should be present and be partners in decisions that affect their field, whether it be in the development of training programmes or of standards for practice. Critical Link 3 has been an excellent opportunity for us to share our ideas, theories and experience... Throughout the conference, it has been evident that the need for appropriate professional training for community interpreters is now fully recognised. The next step will be the acknowledgement of community interpreters as professionals. As professionals they can then come together to create a united professional body and gain recognition, better working conditions and the ability to make living in the community interpretation field.

Differences with regard to self-perception, identity, and attitudes were noted between groups. Many of these disparities can be attributed to socio-cultural norms, as well as established hierarchies of interpersonal and intrapersonal identity expression, with clear definition along audiological boundaries. It was expected that hearing-impaired individuals from hearing-impaired familial backgrounds would have more positive attitudes and perceptions than hearing individuals from hearing familial backgrounds.

Excerpt: We will be dealing with the professional relationship between a social worker and an interpreter and their interactions with people who are emotionally scarred, extremely distressed, and have completely lost their bearings. What are the barriers to overcome in order to reach out to these people and join them in their suffering? How can we create a feeling of trust despite the linguistic, ethnocultural, gender, socio-political, and psychological obstacles? How is it possible for a social worker and an interpreter to join together to help these people take control of their lives despite the vulnerability, culture shock, and fear that they are experiencing? Through psychosocial interventions, we will demonstrate the process used during interviews, which enables us to establish the bond to support them and grasp their innermost feelings. While capturing their spirits, we are able to create some "magical moments" where the client feels free to express himself and gradually regain control over his life.

While mainstreaming the deaf person into society seems to be the wave of the future, and there are positive aspects to this, careful consideration, respect, and acknowledgement must be given to the special culture of the deaf person. Employing existing therapeutic methods, with only the adjustment of supplying an interpreter for the Deaf, may not be enough. (19 pp.)

A psychotherapeutic relationship is a relationship between two individuals: a  clinician and a patient, both of whom usually speak the same language.  However, this duo changes into a trio when the patient is deaf and  communicates through sign language and when the therapist does not  understand this idiom. In this article, we look at different intervention settings  and the characteristics of various psychotherapeutic approaches. We discuss  the specificity of clinical work with a deaf person who communicates through an  interpreter and the forces that are at work between the individuals participating  in this situation. We present an overview of the elements that could potentially  damage the therapeutic alliance. Lastly, we address the key points that  contribute to its success and that take the reality of the need for a third person  into account. This is a downloadable PDF file.

Oxford University Press. Abstract: Twenty-eight sign language interpreters participated in a battery of tests to determine if a profile of cognitive, motor, attention, and personality attributes might distinguish them as a group and at different credential levels. Eight interpreters held Level II and nine held Level III Virginia Quality Assurance Screenings (VQAS); the other 11 held Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) certification. Six formal tests, the Quick Neurological Screening Test-II, the Wonderlic Personnel Test, the Test of Visual-Motor Skills (TVMS), the d2 Test of Attention, the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test, and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF), were administered to the interpreters. Average scores were high on most of the tests; differences across the three groups were not statistically significant. Results from only one test, the d2 Test of Attention, were significantly correlated with interpreter level. Comparisons between educational and community interpreters also revealed no differences. Personality traits were widely distributed, but one trait, abstract reasoning, tested extremely high in 18 interpreters. Discussion of the potential implications of these results, particularly for educational interpreters, is offered.

Excerpt: The complexity of community interpretation is always challenging. This is particularly so when one must take into account radically different cultures and highly dissimilar values and social systems. For example, must one attempt to, and how can one, transmit the ambiguity of Asian speech when interpreting towards a Western language that is much more direct without betraying the spirit of the meaning when one language uses a high degree of ambiguity and the other more direct? Interpreters are the links that transform cultural differences into solidarity. They are also the bridges that allow communities to come together and communicate harmoniously.

Today, government agencies, both state and federal, have “come of age,” and are demanding strict adherence to elaborate “Scopes of Work” in their RFQs/RFPs.

Excerpt: The Granville College of TAFE (Technical and Further Education) is situated in Granville, a suburb in western Sydney with a high concentration of Arab migrants. It began offering courses in community interpreting in mid 1996. The college also offers other interpreting courses in Turkish and Farsi. Training in Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese is offered at other TAFE colleges. The courses cater for the high demand for interpreters to assist migrants in the traditional areas of welfare, legal and health settings. The present study examines some aspects of interpreter training which are different from those commonly encountered in conference interpreter training. It also focuses on non-European languages in migrant communities.

Excerpt: Since the early 1980's French Sign Language (LSF) interpreters intervene in many new areas, for example theatre performances and conferences, or assisting deaf students attending secondary school and university courses. Meanwhile, LSF interpreters continue to work in many social domains. In both cases, interpretation is a decisive factor in the social integration of the deaf person. However, there is a gap between the bilingual French - French Sign Language deaf student, well integrated into the community, and a deaf person with little or no education, or no language skills at all. It is not just a question of linguistics. The interpreter must be able to convey meaning without reference to a language, adapt to the audience and to the context, assist the speaker in adapting to the context, and evaluate the intercultural and social scope of the interpretation. These elements constitute the basis of the interpreter training programme.

Excerpt: When interpreters interrupt proceedings they move away from their strict role as mouthpiece and become active participants. Knowing when and how to interrupt proceedings is a very difficult decision for interpreters, as any interruption will inevitably have ramifications on the case. This paper will present the results of a study on interpreter interruptions based on 17 Local Court Hearings in New South Wales, Australia. It was found that interpreters interrupt for a variety of reasons: to ask for clarification of a question or an answer, to correct a question when it is an obvious unintentional mistake, to finish interpreting a previous, interrupted utterance, to provide unsolicited information, to offer a personal opinion, or to protest to the Bench. The study found that very few interruptions were justifiable, although some were well intentioned. This paper will explore the reasons behind each interruption and discuss their consequences.

Sworn translators may be called to act in legal situations, or representatives of the community of friends or family "who speak the language" unofficially play the role of the community interpreter. Rather than speaking of community interpreters as such, we perhaps should think of interpreters involved in the community, their work and training not being restricted to simultaneous booth work. Nowhere should this be more so than the Catholic University São Paulo (PUC), one of the homes of Brazilian Liberation Theology, which has a strong tradition of working for and with poorer communities.

Naturally, demands for interpreters of various languages became urgent. However, a lack of understanding and the absence of a training system for court interpreters have placed physical and psychological burdens on the interpreters. In 1992, the Japan Judicial Interpreters' Association was organized by several court interpreters in Osaka who created a communication network among isolated court interpreters for the exchange of information and for self training with the co-operation of lawyers, and won mass media support. This movement has placed pressure on the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court and succeeded in gaining understanding of the authorities. As a result, the working conditions of the court interpreters are greatly improving.

Excerpt: The Chicago area court interpreters certification project has not been an easy one. The fear of being saddled with unfamiliar standards posed a threat on our already comfortable and established system. Administrators only knew that the court interpreters were getting the work done. Academia knew nothing about court interpreting and very little about the needs of the community for such professionals. With this background, we looked to the certification project as a guiding light. It had literally taken years to have court interpreters and court administrators consider the court interpreters' certification programme. That is why it is imperative that any policy for offering the certification exams include in the negotiations the members who ultimately will be responsible for offering the certification in any given state. If not done, the objective, which is to certify court interpreters, is not accomplished and this will only be one more exam without much meaning.

In June 2002, I spent three, very full days in Paris at a conference on translation  and interpretation, offered under the auspices of UNESCO. The fact that there  were more presentations on interpretation than on translation suited most of the  participants just fine. Forty presenters from 19 different countries provided an  overview of events in the world of legal translation and interpretation, both oral  and visual. 4 Sub-themes included recognition of the professional status of  interpreters who do court work, and training and preparation. This article begins with a description of the main challenges reported by legal  interpreters, then describes the solutions they propose. It concludes with a brief  description of working conditions in some of the countries that were represented  at the conference.  This is a downloadable PDF file.

This places a greater emphasis on the meaning than on the representations. Working a posteriori has allowed us to give a new dimension to a so-called mechanical translation.
