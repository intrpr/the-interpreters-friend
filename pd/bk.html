ISBN-10: 075700007X, ISBN-13: 978-0757000072. The book covers more than 900 signs that represent nearly 1,800 words and phrases, with signs grouped by topic, e.g., common and polite phrases; mealtime and food; school and education; careers, jobs and the workplace; and the body and health. One or more photos of professional signers demonstrating the sign formation accompany a discussion of each sign. Perhaps most useful is the "visualize" portion of each entry, which often explains the essence of the sign. For example, when signing the word "farmer," which involves moving one's hand across the chin and then down the chest, visualize yourself depicting "the bushy beard of a farmer." Especially valuable are the educational sidebars on what it's like to live as a deaf person in the U.S., including a suggested reading list on the history of deaf culture, a discussion of how technology has created more career options for deaf people and a list of American films featuring deaf protagonists.

The vocabulary was carefully chosen to be useful to everyday conversation. The 341 illustrations include an extensive list of synonyms, creating a sign index of 1,325 English words. A DVD accompanies the book. It demonstrates the 341 illustrations of the book, and has 341 short messages that use the vocabulary of the book. It also demonstrates the numbers and the ASL alphabet.

Following a general introduction to American Sign Language and Deaf Culture, the author explains the use of "facial grammar" as a preliminary step to learning and understanding manual signing. Two succeeding chapters present the first eleven key grammatical rules of ASL. The 36 lessons that follow are divided into four groups that put these rules into practice and introduce additional rules. All lessons conclude with a practice session that reviews the lesson's material and progressively develops the student's proficiency in communicating in ASL.

ISBN 0674587480. The term "Mother Father Deaf" refers to the sign language phrase identifying hearing children who have deaf parents (CODAs, or Children Of Deaf Adults).  In this powerful examination based on interviews with 150 hearing adults with deaf parents, Preston presents the personal stories of this diverse group and in the process reveals the unique struggles of living between two cultures-Deaf and Hearing. Rather than attempting to identify dysfunction in such families, Preston allows the individual stories, family histories, childhood memories, and adult perspectives to paint a vivid picture of the experiences of being culturally deaf yet functionally hearing.  Mother father Deaf incorporates research findings from linguistics, anthropology, psychological development, and sociology, making it useful for educators, researchers, rehabilitation counselors, and social workers.

The decisions that parents or guardians make on behalf of their children, often based on the contributions of educators, habilitation/rehabilitation specialists, and the Deaf and medical communities, deserve an airing in a comprehensive manner. What are the issues concerning amplification, implantation, visual communication systems, and sign languages? What technological route should the parents take? What language should they be trying to develop in their child? What educational setting and approach will best satisfy the needs of their child and themselves for the present and foreseeable future?

This book addresses the language development process from multiple perspectives, drawing on the latest research in bilingual-biculturalism, cochlear implant technology and neuroscience.

At the heart of Lorraine Fletcher's book is the battle raging between educators who favor sign language as the best mode of teaching the deaf and those advocating oral methods. Although Lorraine and her son Ben live in England, this educational conflict is duplicated in the United States. Of the two camps offering conflicting advice about the best way to educate deaf children, Fletcher is clearly in the "sign" camp and makes a persuasive argument for her position. Faced with the problem of finding the right way to educate Ben, who is profoundly deaf, Lorraine explores each issue involved in effective deaf education and attempts to give her son the best possible choices.

Throughout the chapters, myths surrounding deafness are dispelled and the salient characteristics of Deaf culture that lie at the heart of the Deaf community are examined. Special attention is given to the anatomy and physiology of the hearing mechanism, and recent advances in hearing aids, modern technology, and an annotated list of support services are provided.

Like so many EMTs, he faced the tragedies and hazards associated with his job with unflagging courage and little fanfare.

Silent Alarm is a gripping story of survival, so overwhelming in its gritty details of an EMT's existence that, remarkably, Mr. Schrader's deafness becomes an afterthought.

Written works between 1764 and 1840, edited by Harlan Lane, clearly show how this extraordinary era of French Deaf education influenced the adoption of the manual method by the first schools for deaf students in America, in sharp contrast to the oral movement that repressed sign language-centered education for nearly a century afterward.

Laws were made prohibiting people with "hereditary diseases" - deafness, schizophrenia, physical deformities, epilepsy, blindness, manic-depression, and Huntington's chorea - to procreate. When Hitler came into power, these eugenicists were key in helping compromise those who were deaf. The author reveals the discovery that many prominent teachers actively volunteered the names of deaf students for sterilization, and in some cases murdered, a startling contradiction to the popularized official impression that they were reluctant contributors. This book tells of the atrocities committed on the deaf population during the rule of the Third Reich, told to the author in German Sign Language by over 1,000 deaf survivors.

The human voice is personal, traditionally considered an expression of the innermost self. But what of those who have no voice of their own and cannot hear the voices of others? In this unique historical narrative, Jonathan Ree tells the astonishing story of the deaf, from the sixteenth century to the present. Ree explores the great debates about deafness between those who believed the deaf should be made to speak and those who advocated non-oral communication. He traces the botched attempts to make language visible, through such exotic methods as picture writing, manual spellings, and vocal photography. He also charts the tortuous progress and final recognition of sign systems as natural languages in their own right.

It traces the history of Deaf people in America not from the perspective of pathology, but of culture as the distinguishing characteristic of a distinct community of individuals whose history and achievements are worthy of study. Largely through schools for the Deaf, Deaf people began to develop a common language and a sense of community. A Place of Their Own brings the perspective of history to bear on the reality of deafness and provides fresh and important insights into the lives of Deaf Americans.

When Diane Brewer, the new drama head at MacMurray Collge in Jacksonville, Illinois staged the 1957 classic American musical West Side Story, she added an extra element to the show. She auditioned deaf students to perform half the parts. This book presents a fascinating narrative of Brewer and the unique cast's efforts to mount this challenging play. A keen depiction of how several distinct individuals from two cultures can cooperate to perform a classic American art form brilliantly together. (232 pgs, softcover, 6" x 9")

ISBN 0-9719248-0-5. Poet, playwright, and filmmaker Raymond Luczak's Silence is a Four-Letter Word is a battle-cry for deaf artists everywhere. He challenges them to rethink observations on their work and live differently with his meditations on what makes art "art" and deafness "deaf." Using a multi-platform approach: a short story; rapid-fire mini-essays; a short play; a self-interview, Luczak illustrates his points that "music is a universal lie," "art is risk," and that there needs to be a discussion on "why poetry sucks."

ISBN 0-9719248-1-3 As a boy, deaf author Raymond Luczak delighted in exploring the mysterious attractions of nature in the huge expanse of abandoned woods and fields known as "across the street." In this collection of 48 poems, he remembers encountering the unexpected guests of the woods: a scraggly fox, starving doe, industrious chipmunk, all enveloped against the backdrop of nature. If Luczak remembers the first shimmers of spring, he doesn't forget the stark reality of death, or the forgiving power of seasons. This book is an ode to the overpowering sense of childhood wonder.

On April 5, 1977, thousands of disabled folks in cities all over America converged on their regional offices of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. They held mass rallies outside. They sat in. The issue was the implementation of the regulations that would add the real meat to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The regulations had been written three and one half years earlier in the Ford administration. But since then, they sat awaiting the signature of the HEW Secretary, which was then the lead agency in 504 enforcement. Candidate Jimmy Carter promised that taking action on this would be a top priority for his administration.

Part 1 focuses on deaf students-their perspectives on having interpreters in the classroom, the language myths that surround them, the accessibility of language to them, and their cognition. Part 2 raises questions about the support and training that interpreters receive from the school systems, the qualifications that many interpreters bring to an interpreted education, and the accessibility of everyday classrooms for deaf students placed in such environments. Part 3 presents a few of the possible suggestions for addressing the concerns of interpreted educations, and focuses primarily on the interpreter. The contributors discuss the need to (1) define the core knowledge and skills interpreters must have and (2) develop standards of practice and assessment. They also stress that interpreters cannot effect the necessary changes alone; unless and until administrators, parents, teachers, and students recognize the inherent issues of access to education through mediation, little will change for deaf students.

Interviews with lawyers, judges, expert witnesses and Deaf people themselves give an insight into the needs and misconceptions of all parties involved in the legal process. It points out how interpreter education programs and professional associations must evaluate their programs to insure that interpreters are receiving the appropriate training in the use of consecutive and simultaneous interpreting necessary for legal environments.

Like so many EMTs, he faced the tragedies and hazards associated with his job with unflagging courage and little fanfare. Unlike other EMTs, he also dealt with other obstacles presented by his severe hearing loss, including bias. Silent Alarm is a gripping story of survival, so overwhelming in its gritty details of an EMT's existence that, remarkably, Mr. Schrader's deafness becomes an afterthought.

The study was designed to determine whether there are disparities in sex knowledge between hearing college freshmen at the University of Maryland (n=75) and Loyola College in Baltimore (n=128), a total hearing population tested of N=203, and deaf college freshmen at Gallaudet University (n=38). The Sex Knowledge Inventory (SKI), an instrument previously developed and tested by the researcher to measure sex information including: masturbation, homosexuality, reproduction, birth control, anatomy and physiology, sexual intercourse, and AIDS, was used to assess sex knowledge. Additionally, the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test (SKAT), Knowledge portion, was used in assessment and comparison to determine the reliability of the SKI. Factor analyses were performed to determine content validity in the parsing of data in the SKI. ANOVAs were performed in comparing answers to questionnaire items by the two populations.  Findings of this research support the SKI as a valid instrument for assessing sex knowledge in both hearing and deaf populations. Additionally, the data collected demonstrate that deaf college freshmen lag behind hearing college freshmen in nearly every aspect of sex knowledge examined. The disparities found suggest that further investigation should be conducted to clarify the reasons for the lack of sexuality information revealed by deaf students. 205 pp.
