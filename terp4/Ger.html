<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>	Occasionally an interpreter is confronted with a text that
includes words from a foreign language, be it a scholarly quote in
Latin or Greek or a clever saying in Spanish or French.  At this
point we usually trust the speaker to translate it into English
momentarily, and while we're waiting we merely sign <B>NOW SPEAK
FOREIGN LANGUAGE</B>, or if we recognize the language we would say
which one it was.  What happens when the point of the discourse is to
learn the foreign language itself?  I hope to make some suggestions
that would be helpful to an ASL interpreter for such a setting, using
my experience interpreting for German courses.  It is now seen as politically correct to say "second language", rather than "foreign language".  I think this is confusing since this will be the deaf person's third language if they use Sign and know English.  I shall use the term "foreign language" throughout this paper.

<P><B>Preparation</B>

<P>	The task is difficult enough without having a previous
knowledge of the language being taught.  Interpreters for foreign
language classes really should have had at least two years of
instruction in the foreign language they will interpret, even for an
introductory course in that language.  It may have been years since
they used the foreign language they learned in high school, but with
some preparation before each class it will come back to them.  If
they start by interpreting the first introductory course, they will
relearn it with ease.  As a last resort, interpreters with no
knowledge of the language can start by interpreting German 1 and
working their way up.  Increasing numbers of interpreters have a
third language, besides ASL and English, and I believe that a third
language, whether it's a spoken language or a signed language, is
very helpful for further breaking away from the unavoidable
ethnocentrism that monolinguals may have.  

<P>	Having the textbook for the class is essential.  By following
the syllabus and reading ahead, the interpreter can know which
aspects of the language and which vocabulary items will be dealt with
in class on any given day.  Remember to bring the book to class
because it will help you let the deaf students know where you are. 
The teacher may ask a question from the book without mentioning the
number of the question, and by checking your copy of the book you can
tell them where to read, instead of laboriously fingerspelling the
question when they could get it faster by reading it in the text.  If
the students are reading an extended passage from the book, you might
as well tell the deaf students where the class is in the textbook
and have them read along.  It may be difficult for you to understand
some hearing students when they read German or speak it.  We know that it takes more effort to interpret a speaker with a heavy accent or a foreign Deaf person who may have remnants of his/her foreign sign language mixed into their ASL. All the more so when we hear mispronounced German, which is at best a second language for most of us.  Having the book turned to the right page may help you use cloze to figure out which German words they are trying to pronounce.   

<P>	Doing the homework is also very helpful, especially if the
language is new to the interpreter or has been unused for several
years.  If the interpreter does not wish to purchase the textbook and
cannot get a copy from the teacher or library, it is possible to
order a desk copy<A href="Ger.html#1"><sup>1</sup></A> by writing to the publisher.  If
that doesn't work, xerox the pages you need, use an old German text,
or borrow the teacher's text at a regular time when you are free and
the teacher is busy with other things.  Consider tutoring or working
together with the student if you are reasonably competent in the
language.  If you are just learning German with the class you can
still use the time to figure out together how German works and what
the student thinks would work best for her/himself in terms of
representing the language using ASL, DGS (German Sign Language), fingerspelling, or Cued Speech.

<P><B>Orthographic challenges</B>

<P>	Fingerspelling every word would definitely represent a foreign
language exactly if it doesn't have a different alphabet, but it is
just too much for most deaf people's eyes and the interpreter's
hands.  It is still necessary to fingerspell at least some words to
introduce them, emphasize them, talk about spelling, and show
affixes, declensions, and conjugations.  Roman letters can be
represented by fingerspelling, but some languages, such as Hebrew,
Russian, or Greek, have different alphabets.  Other languages, such
as Chinese and Japanese, use ideograms to represent words which are
not built up through a succession of letters that would guide in the
pronunciation (although Japanese has three alphabets for some words
and affixes).  If the students and the interpreter learn the manual
alphabet of a foreign language, it would save the interpreter from
needing to transliterate<A href="Ger.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A>  the words.   

<P>	Some languages have additional letters through the addition of
diacritical marks or other devices - such as French (&ccedil;,
&eacute;, &egrave;, and o^), German (&auml;, &ouml;, &uuml;,  and
&szlig;), and Spanish (&aacute;, &eacute;, &iacute;, &ntilde;,
&oacute;, &uacute;, and &uuml;).  One method that is used by the Deaf
in Germany to represent umlauts  (&auml;, &ouml;, and &uuml;) as well
as the es-tsett (&szlig;) is to move the fingerspelled letter
downwards.  An umlaut can also be represented by an "e" following the
letter (such as "Tuer" for "T&uuml;r") but students will more often
see the umlaut, so a visual equivalent is helpful.  The best single
resource for researching manual alphabets is by Simon Carmel, listed
in the bibliography.  

<P>	French, German, and Spanish fingerspelling differs from ASL
even in some letters that look the same in written form.  I see no
need to use the special French "F" for example.  I found it
interesting that "ch" and "sch" in German are looked upon as
diphthongs in terms of fingerspelling and are represented by a single
handshape, but it may be confusing to use these, since spelling <B>C-H</B> or <B>S-C-H</B> could serve just as well.  Check with your consumer for their preference.  There are also differences between the manual alphabet of the
previously existent countries of East and West Germany.  Just pick
one that the interpreter and the students can agree on. Below is a German fingerspelling chart.

<P><IMG SRC="phono.gif" HEIGHT="50" ALT="chattering teeth"><A HREF="Ger.html#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>   <B>Phonological challenges</B> 

<P>	Every language has a slightly different phonology or way to
pronounce its letters.  The interpreter needs to find out what the
students want from their course.  Do they want to learn how to
pronounce, speechread, or only read and write the language?  This is
a good discussion to have with the teacher present, so that s/he can
become aware of what modifications might need to be made.  This will
bring up the broader questions of how the deaf student should
recite: using voice, fingerspelling everything, some sign and some
fingerspelling, or cued speech.

<P>	Cued Speech could come in very handy for representing a foreign
language if the consumer knows it or wishes to learn it, since it
represents the pronunciation (and the individual words) in a way that
the eye can take in, rather than fingerspelling every word. Languages like French offer difficulty in so far as the pronunciation does not correspond to the spelling, but this is the same difficulty that hearing students have with such languages.  As mentioned above, phonologies differ, so special cueing systems have been developed to represent phonemes that do not exist in English - French (j and r), German (ch, &ouml;, r, and &uuml;), and Spanish (&aacute;, &eacute;, &iacute;, j, l, &ntilde;, &oacute;, &uacute;, &uuml;, r, rr, and x). 
The bibliography mentions some articles on this aspect.

<P><B>Semantic challenges</B>

<P>	Representing form or meaning is a choice that interpreters make
daily as they decide what the goal of the communication is (such as
the title of a book, a technical phrase, or a common saying) and what the communication mode of the consumer is (ASL or PSE) .  All of us are familiar with the difficulty of representing English in ASL, and I personally agree
with those that feel English should not be taught to the deaf
through signing, but should be taught as a written language with
explanations in ASL.  This would probably work best for foreign
languages also, but deaf people certainly have a right of access to
foreign language classes, especially if this is the only way they can
satisfy their degree requirements for a foreign language.  

<P>	There is a teaching method using computers which is generally
referred to as CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning), although
specific programs have been developed with their own names.  If such
programs are available at the school where the foreign language is
being taught, the teacher may be able to give the deaf person
guidance on how to use the computer programs to good effect, since
they serve to promote reading and writing, rather than working
through an auditory mode.  See the bibliography for some articles on
this methodology.

<P>	An exciting development has been the blossoming of awareness
about foreign sign languages.  I look forward to the day that deaf
people can get academic credit for learning these sign languages as
well.  It may be instructive to learn the bascis of a sign language for the country whose spoken language you are interpreting.  There is a German Sign Language dictionary at <A HREF="http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/ALex/Start.htm">"Das Vokabelheft" (Allgemeines Gebärdenlexikon) </A>, and for other indigenous sign language dictionaries, see <A HREF="../indj/dcoew/toc.html">Indigenous Deaf cultures and sign languages of the world</A>.  Consult with the deaf
person to see if they wish you to use foreign signs to represent some
of the frequently occurring words in the foreign spoken language they
are learning.  They may wish the signed language of a specific
country.  For example, it they are learning German, they have the
choice of North German, South German, Austrian, or Swiss Sign
Languages.  Some very basic words may be helpful to know how to sign
in this language.  When I interpreted for my introductory German
class, I started with the German signs for "Guten Morgen (Good morning)",
"Herr (Mr.)", "Frau (Mrs.)", "ja (yes)", and "nein (no)".  Concepts
in the language that have no English equivalent could be negotiated
in this way, and as a matter of fact ASL is now incorporating such
signs as <B>SUSHI</B>, <B>SMORGASBORD</B>, and <B>VODKA</B>. Some
French, Spanish, and German Sign Language texts are cited in the
bibliography.

<P>	We've alluded to the difficulty of teaching English in ASL, and
it's even more complicated for other spoken languages.  Foreign
countries, especially if they have a strong contingent that support
oralism, may have an invented system (parallel to Manual Codes for
English) to represent their spoken language, but this requires that
the deaf person learn three languages: the written language, the
signed language, and the manual code!  Invented systems would not be
beneficial anyway, for the same reason that MCEs only lead to
confusion and are dropped by students and even teachers inadvertently
due to their visual clumsiness.  

<P>	The method I used in my recent class was unvoiced Sim-Com, that
is mouthing, in my case, German while simultaneously using
conceptually accurate ASL signs and fingerspelling.  The method you
decide to use should be negotiated with your consumer.  If there is
no one-to-one match between English and ASL, which share some of the
same culture, imagine trying to find one ASL sign for a given German
word!  This is where sign negotiation comes in.  I never felt so
needed as when I interpreted my German course.  I dragged myself to
work on days I would have otherwise stayed home because there were a
limited number of German-speaking interpreters, it was an eight
o-clock class, and no one but me knew what I had negotiated with the
students.  

<P>	Here is a guide to some of the words that I find are helpful to
fingerspell.  For all sentences I would emphasize again that I mouth
the German: it emphasizes to the students that German is being
represented, not English; it may remind the students of some of the
German words, if they can speechread them; it helps the interpreter
attend to finding lexical equivalents for German and ASL (no easy
task!)  

<P>	(1) Words that are being introduced for the first few times -
"Wie hei&szlig;t du?" ("What's you name?") = <B>W-I-E 
H-E-I-&szlig;-T  YOU</B> (or <B>D-U</B>)?  Later when the focus is
off "hei&szlig;en" and that word has been learned, you could replace
fingerspelling with a sign - "Meine Frau hei&szlig;t Lisa" ("My
wife's name is Lisa") could be represented as <B>MY WIFE is-CALLED
L-I-S-A</B>.

<P>	(2) German verbs are highly inflected so their conjugation
should be reinforced through fingerspelling - "Ich liebe, Sie lieben,
du liebst, er/sie/es liebt" ["I love, you (formal) love, you
(informal) love, he/she/it loves"] = <B>ME  L-I-E-B-E, <U>YOU</U> 
L-I-E-B-E-N, YOU  L-I-E-B-S-T, INDEX </B>(<TT>or </TT><B>E-R</B>,<B>
S-I-E</B>,<B> E-S</B>)<B>  L-I-E-B-T</B>.  Note that
<B><U>YOU</U></B> represents the honorific index, where the palm
orientation is upwards and the hands sweeps downwards with the
fingertips pointing to the person that is being referred to.

<P>	Note: there are four singular and four plural forms for every
verb in German.  These correspond to the pronouns (1) ich, (2) du,
(3) Sie, and (4) er/sie/es in the singular and (1) wir, (2) ihr, (3)
Sie, and (4) sie in the plural.  These could be referred back to
quickly without repeatedly mentioning the pronouns by indexing them
on the four fingers of the non-dominant hand for the singular and on
the four fingers of the dominant hand for the plural. 

<P>	(3) Similarly with German nouns, pronouns, or articles in
declension (such as "der, des, dem, den": the definite article "the",
masculine, singular, in nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative
cases) - "Sie wohnt in einem Studentenwohnheim" ("She lives in a
dorm") = <B>S-I-E  LIVE IN  E-I-N-E-M DORM</B>.  This assumes that
the students have already learned the German word for "dorm" and that
it is not necessary at present to focus on conjugation of the third
person singular (wohnt).    

<P>	(4) Fingerspell and sign the substituted words in a
substitution drill - "Welche Farbe hat das Buch?  Welche Farbe hat
das Papier?  Welche Farbe hat die Wand? . . ." ("What color is the
book?  . . . the paper? . . . the wall? . . .)  <B>WHICH COLOR HAVE
BOOK, D-A-S  B-U-C-H?  . . . PAPER, D-A-S  P-A-P-I-E-R? . . .  WALL,
D-I-E  W-A-N-D? . . .</B>

<P>	(5) Fingerspell and sign words that are being used in an
idiomatic way - "was machst du?" (literally "what do you make?")
means "what's up?", so I would sign  <B>WHAT'S-UP</B>, <B>W-A-S 
M-A-C-H-T-S  D-U?</B>

<P>	(6) I fingerspell more of a given sentence to reinforce old
ideas when I have extra time.   A particularly good time for this is
when the teacher says a sentence and the class is supposed to repeat
it, or when students are slowly responding to a question from the
teacher.  I find that as the students get more advanced they can
tolerate more fingerspelling in the foreign language and need it to
break away from thinking in ASL or English but rather in the foreign
language itself. 

<P><B>Syntactic challenges</B>

<P>	German syntax differs from ASL (and English).  Separable prefix
verbs are a single word in uninflected form, such as "ausgehen" ("to
go out"), but separate into two parts when inflected.  For example,
"Peter und Maria gehen am Donnerstag aus" ("Peter and Maria go out on
Thursdays", literally, "Peter and Maria go on Thursday out.")  I have
not found a satisfactory way to represent such a syntactically
different form.  I end up explaining a great deal during these trying
sentences: cultural mediation at its most frantic!  For the previous
sentence (while mouthing German) I would sign <B>P-E-T-E-R AND
M-A-R-I-A GO ON THURSDAY A-U-S, (aside) THAT MEAN EVERY-THURSDAY
TWO-OF-THEM GO-TOGETHER</B>.  As I've mentioned before, spelling out
everything seems to be an information overload, but each interpreter
needs to negotiate with their students to see how much is too much.  

<P>	Some phrases behave like separable prefix verbs.  For example,
"ins Bett gehen" ("to go to bed') - "Er geht um 23 Uhr ins Bett" ("He
goes to bed around 11 pm", literally "He goes around 11 pm into
bed.")  There is a sign <B>GO-TO-BED</B>, but to show the word order
one might sign <B>E-R GO THEREABOUTS 23 HOUR I-N-S  B-E-T-T, (aside)
THAT MEAN H-E TEND GO-TO-BED 11 P-M THEREABOUTS.</B>  Other common
syntactic differences are dependent clauses - "Ich bleibe im Bett,
wenn ich krank bin"  ("I stay in bed, whenever I'm sick", literally,
"I stay in bed, when(ever) I sick am"), and the perfect tense, when
there are two parts to the verb - "Bertolt Brecht ist 1956 in Berlin
gestorben" ("Bertolt Brecht died in Berlin in 1956"), where "ist" and
"gestorben" together mean "died".  The first sentence could be
interpreted <B>ME STAY IN BED, WHEN ME SICK B-I-N, (aside) THAT MEAN
SUPPOSE ME SICK, ME TEND STAY BED</B>, and the second sentence would
need to be fingerspelled completely and then interpreted into ASL. 

<P><B>Working with the students</B>

<P>	As mentioned before, find out the goal(s) of the students in
learning the foreign language: do they want to be able to speechread
native speakers, write and read only, or also be able to pronounce
the language?  Remember to negotiate signs, how much fingerspelling
is desired, and how will the students represent the "answer" to
questions from the teacher - will they fingerspell the sentence, use
voiced or unvoiced Sim-Com, Cued Speech, or some other option?  It
can be difficult for the interpreter to know when they are assuming
that all the endings are correct or that they (the interpreter) are
using cloze skills to fill in what the answer should be.  If the
students are not interested in speechreading or speaking the
language, pronunciation drills will not be helpful in themselves, so
perhaps the time could be used to merely spell out what the class is
saying and interpret it, to give the students more exposure to the
language.    

<P>	Another method that has been used where the interpreter works
even more closely with the student is to use a laptop computer to
"caption" the class.  The interpreter types the drills and dialogue. 
The student and the interpreter can then practice the drills by
typing on the laptop while the other students practice orally.  At
the end the session can be printed and saved for further study.

<P>	A related method is to use a voice recognition system.  The
teacher wears a microphone and their speech is translated into text
on a computer screen.  One drawback is that the present
state-of-the-art requires the person whose speech will be transcribed
to spend many hours training the computer to become accustomed to
their voice and will therefore require extra work from the teacher
(as much as 15 hours). The system also can not transcribe spoken text
from audiotapes or videotapes that might be used to supplement the
hearing students' auditory training unless similar session are used
to accustom the computer again.  The computer will aso make some
transcription mistakes that will have to be corrected later.  Voice
recognition programs dedicated to the language in question may be
necessary to show diacritical marks.  On the positive end, it will
allow the interpreter to use their hands for interpreting so that
they will not be flitting from keyboard to ASL or falling behind in
the lecture and will lessen repetitive motion problems.     

<P><B>Working with the teacher</B>

<P>	It is always essential to be a team player with the teacher,
and in foreign language classes it is inescapable.  Show your
interest in doing the readings and homework, so that the teacher will
realize early on that the task of interpreting is more than a lexical
skill like taking dictation.  Some language classes use TPR (total
physical response), where commands are given in the language, like
"Springen Sie!" ("Jump up and down!").  For such situations it is
especially important to interpret first and then fingerspell so that
the time used for processing doesn't make the deaf students look
slow.  

<P>	If students pair up for spoken dialogues delivered during a
later class period as homework, the teacher might simply give the
deaf students more written work as a substitute.  If there is an
auditory comprehension part to the tests, where the students listen
to an audiotape and answer questions on what they heard, the teacher
could have an additional written part for the deaf students' test. 
If there is group work and there is only one deaf student, ask the
teacher if it is best to interpret for a hearing partner or if the
interpreter should work with the student.  

<P><B>Summary</B>

<P>	Interpreting for a foreign language course presents a number of
interesting challenges for interpreters, but by working with the
teacher and students and preparing well for each class, it can be
made to work.  The teacher will have an opportunity to use creativity
in redesigning some materials for the deaf students as well as to
be exposed to yet another language (ASL) which may make them think
more deeply about the relationship of language and culture. 
Interpreters will firm up their skills in the foreign language being
taught and intercultural mediation.  The deaf students will be able
to gain access to a foreign language that will broaden their way of
thinking about the world.

O. <A HREF="http://www.cuedspeech.org/sub/cued/language.asp">Adapting Cued Speech to additional languages.</A> As of October, 1993, Cued Speech had been adapted to 56 languages and major dialects. In most of these adaptations, the writer had the assistance of one or more native speakers of the target language. In a few cases he had advice from experts on the phonetic and phonological aspects of the language in question. Other persons produced five of the adaptations (Alu, Malagasy, Maltese, Korean and Polish) with little or no guidance from the writer. [Webmaster's comment: German is included in this list and audiotapes are said to be available.]
