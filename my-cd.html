<P><A NAME="dict"><IMG SRC="sgb.gif" HSPACE="10"><A HREF="http://www.signs-of-development.org/website/PDS1510d.htm">Technical & specialized vocabulary resource dictionary.</A> Over 15,000 entries. This dictionary offers a way to deal with a wide spectrum of topic areas that interpreters are faced with everyday. Rather than offer these in alphabetical order, like most dictionaries, hypermedia allows interpreters to learn vocabulary in the order they are needed, according to what challenges their assignments give them. Few people would think of a dictionary as a professional development vehicle, but by selecting assignments, learning through the classroom and doing selective homework, the interpreter can build understanding and vocabulary simultaneously. <DIR> 

<P>The dictionary is set up in major categories and further subdivided into categories making navigation as simple as point and click and each entry shows David as the sign model signing the term.
