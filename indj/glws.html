<li>Vocabulary items for countries are listed by geographic area as delineated by <i>The World Almanac Atlas </i>(London: George Philip, Ltd., 1990). Cities are listed 	separately, according to their country, in alphabetic order.
<li>The handshape(s) used are enclosed in brackets. For foreign visitors to this site who are unfamiliar with ASL fingerspelling, see <A HREF="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/fingerspelling/abc.htm">The fingerspelled alphabet</A> for the handshapes. If the sign is two-handed and the handshapes are the same, (2h) is used before the handshape.
<li>If two-handed, but the handshapes are different, DH (dominant hand) is used, indicating the handshape, later listing NDH (non-dominant hand). NDH may be omitted since the other handshape must now be on the NDH.  
<li>Palm orientations are specified: PO up, PO down, PO > NDS (toward non-dominant side), PO > DS (toward dominant side), PO >< (palms face each other). 	
<li>FO specifies fingertip orientation, similarly to PO. Remember FO is 			defined in linguistics as the direction the fingertips would point if they were 		extended, not based on a closed handshape.
<li>Fingerspelling is indicated capital letters separated by dashes. Single letters are slightly shaken in neutral space and are indicated by quotation marks around a single letter.	
<li>The last item, "&lt;" (etymology, sign origin), is speculation I have heard from others or my own best guess.
<li>Since I have frequently found more than one sign for each country, and it 	is hard to check for accuracy unless you know a Deaf native of the given country, I have indicated where I have obtained the sign cited by providing a link to the reference. These references are not in alphabetical order because I am always discovering new sources and it is too time-consuming to keep changing the links. They appear as numbers (footnotes) at the end of each entry which is anchored to a list of references at the end of the list.
