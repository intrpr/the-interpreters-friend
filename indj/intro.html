<P>	There is a movement among some Deaf people to use indigenous
signs for foreign countries and their cities.  By indigenous I mean,
for example, the Japanese Sign Language sign for "Japan", rather than
the ASL sign.  This development has been sparked by an increasing
interaction between American and foreign Deaf people through
activities such as international Deaf sports, Deaf Way, Deaf tourists
(who can communicate more easily with foreign Deaf than Hearing
people in a similar situation), Deaf missionary work, and Deaf people
working in such settings as the Peace Corps.  Should interpreters
begin to use these signs in their work too? 

<P>	I believe two articles from <I>Silent News</I> are very helpful in examining this issue.  The articles are "A
sign of African-American pride" by Emmanuel Azodeh, March 1994, and
"In England, deaf community fights to keep their offensive signs" by
Rajeev Syal, month? 1994.  Azodeh discusses the various signs that
have been used for "Africa" over the years.  Since Africa is a
continent, not a country, there is no indigenous sign for it, but it
is interesting to see the emotions that a sign can evoke, just as
labels of ethnic groups evoke emotions: consider "Negro", "Colored
People", "People of Color", "Afro-American", "Black", and "African
American".

<P>	To encapsulate the parts of his article that are of interest to
us here,  Azodeh says that around 1989 the sign for Africa,
which begins with a <B>[5]</B> handshape, palm orientation away from signer, tracing a half circle to the dominant side while closing to an <B>[O]</B> and dropping slightly, replaced the sign where an <b>[A]</b> circles the face.  The
original sign for Africa was derived from Swahili and began at the
forehead  and circled the face.  This represented the African
continent and a profile of the "African Mother": that is, Africa as
the cradle of civilization.  People would point to the face to
represent specific countries, such as "Nigeria" would be under the
chin.  I would comment that we see how the origin of a sign can be
tied to a very tender and loving concept with significant
metanotative impact.  

<P>	Later when the sign for Europe changed, "Africa" shifted to
begin from the jaw rather than the forehead, but the circular
movement resembled <B>BEAUTIFUL</B> as in the expression "Black is
beautiful."  The sign first mentioned that starts with a <b>[5]</b> surfaced
in the 1970s.  In 1990 Azodeh traveled to Nigeria and shared this
sign with the Deaf people there.  They preferred the sign at the face
because this allowed the viewer to maintain eye contact with the
signer.  Breaking eye contact implies looking down on something. 
Other signs are illustrated and rejected.  Sign etymologies are
always controversial, especially since this is a relatively new
study, but the point I wish to make is that the article shows how
signs, like words, can have a very high emotive impact, and this
should be taken into consideration when selecting or maintaining a
given sign.  The article is worth reading in its entirety and makes
many points not mentioned for the purpose of this article.  James Womack (quoted in http://m1.aol.com/alysser/teachaslvocab.htm) says of the sign that is a [C] that traces the shape of the continent and closes to a [O^], "The new sign [for Africa] is American and a certain Jack Burns came up with it during a theatrical rehearsal in Los Angeles back in the mid-1970's."

<P>	The other article by Syal, reprinted from the (London) <I>Sunday
Times</I>, discusses how Hearing (my emphasis) people in England are
trying to prevent Deaf people from using some signs that the Hearing
people find offensive.  The signs have come to the attention of
Hearing people by being broadcast on television as part of the BBC's
See Here program.  For example, the sign for Gay is a limp wrist, and
the sign for Jew resembles a hooked nose.  Austin Reeves, chairman of
the Sign Language Committee at the British Deaf Association, said
that the television producers "are in a dangerously powerful position
to dictate language."  I certainly agree that Hearing people should
not make decisions for Deaf people about their language!  This
article is also well worth reading in its entirety.

<P>	Since signs for nations, nationalities and ethnic groups are a
volatile issue, what is an interpreter to do?  Let us consider the
benefits and drawbacks and end with how to ameliorate the drawbacks
if the Deaf consumers are supportive of indigenous signs. The
benefits of using such signs are: (1) it shows the unity of Deaf
Americans with international Deaf people and encourages the former to
help other countries in their struggle for Deaf Rights and
Liberation;  (2) it broadens the perspective of Deaf people by
showing the pervasiveness of Deaf cultures with its consequent
increase in Deaf pride; (3) it respects the right of a foreign
country to self-determination in regard to its own identity; (4) some
ASL signs are seen as insulting or derogatory  (<B>IRELAND</B>,
<B>POLAND</B>, and <B>CHINA</B>) and using indigenous sign avoids
that problem, and (5) it decreases the need for fingerspelling the
many countries that have no ASL sign.  

<P>	The drawbacks are: (1) some D/deaf people prefer the ASL signs
and an interpreter who uses the indigenous signs may appear as if
s/he is legislating sign language; (2) the new signs may be confusing
and hard to get used to (especially for those countries that already
have an ASL sign); (3) Hearing people don't use indigenous names,
such as "jung gwa" for "China" and "Deutschland" for "Germany";  (4)
some indigenous signs are identical or extremely similar (signs that
resemble one another) - such as <B>BELIZE</B> and <B>BRAZIL</B>,
<B>EL-SALVADOR</B> and <B>ARGENTINA</B>, <B>IRAQ</B> and
<B>ENGLAND</B>.

<P>	To ameliorate the drawbacks the interpreter should: (1) use ASL
signs or fingerspelling if the consumers object to the indigenous
ones; (2) use ASL signs if consumers are too confused or be sure to
sign negotiate and watch carefully for backchannel feedback; (3) who
says Deaf people have to follow Hearing culture?  maybe we should
follow Deaf people on this one; and (4) if a country has more than
one indigenous sign, pick the one that is not homologous to ASL, and
if there are none, rely on context.

<P>In a related topic, I have been disturbed by interpreters using offensive signs.  That they were ignorant of these signs was not so bad, but they tried to rationalize their way out of it, which made me think that their ego was more important than possible offense to their consumers. For example, I used to work in Seattle, Washington where Boeing is a big employer of Deaf people (and Hearing people too!)  The standard sign for Boeing is <B>AIRPLANE</B> while mouthing Boeing.  (I always hate it when speaker use Boeing, airplane, airline and airport in the same paragraph!)  For a joke some Deaf people sign <B>BORING</B> with the <B>AIRPLANE</B> or <B>ILY</B> handshape.  It is amusing.  But I saw one interpreter sign that during a formal presentation at a company that is a subcontractor of Boeing.  I advised her that it was inappropriate for the setting and she laughed it off.  "It's such a cute sign," she signed back to me.  She did try to sign Boeing properly but you could see her stumble at it about ten times.  That meant to me that she has always used that sign over and over again for years!  It's not that I am worried about the honor of Boeing, but it is a violation of register to use a mocking sign in the middle of a presentation that is trying to show Boeing in a positive light.  It also draws the attention of the Deaf people away from the topic to this inappropriate sign.  Imagine if a Deaf person were signing at such a gathering and the interpreter voiced "the Boring Company" because some hearing people mock the company in that manner!
      
<P>Another person used the sign <B>N*GGER</B> (N twisting at the side of the nostril).  When I explained that this was a very derogatory sign and offensive to many people, the interpreter replied "Well growing up I saw lots of (White) Deaf people sign that."  I explained that a lot of White hearing people used to use the term "n*gger", but most people realize that this is no longer cool.  Again, it didn't bother me that she didn't realize this, but that she wanted to save face, rather than avoid inadvertent insult.  Understand that I spoke with both of these people in a very respectful and informational tone, not that of a Political Correctnik.

<P>Another example that people should be made aware of while we're on the subject it the sign for Louisiana that looks like <B>EXCRETE</B>.  During an event that happened in Louisiana, the platform interpreter signed this for "Louisiana".  She was later corrected by some Louisianans.  I don't know here reaction but I bring it up as a caution.  This sign is widespread so it is not so amazing that this should happen. 

<P>Sometimes in trying to be PC, some people are offended anyway.  I enjoy using the indigenous signs for countries (their own signs for themselves).  One time in interpreting for a Deaf Chinese woman, I used the sign for <B>CHINA</B> that traces the outline of the Mao jacket across the top of the chest and down the side of the chest.  She did not like this sign because her Mother had grown up in China under Mao and had characterized the Mao regime as very oppressive and so passed down the hatred for everything Mao.

<P>The moral of the story is be aware of signs that are generally seen as offensive, and if some Deaf person is offended by a sign that most Deaf people accept, be flexible enough to change your sign for the moment out of respect for the needs of the Deaf consumer.  If you have several consumers that want different signs, let them decide, and if they can't then go back to what you would use with an explanation that it is to hard to try and use both signs throughout the speech event (presentation, class, interview, what have you.)

<P>The search and dispersion of indigenous signs is an evolving one.  Here is an interesting letter that was originally posted to TERPS-L on 21 July 2003 by Roger Beeson:

<DIR><P>I'm a BSL (British Sign Language) interpreter. The sign described [Webmaster: I had described the currently used sign for <A HREF="cntry/caribbeanbasin.html#jamaica">Jamaica</A>] is the one used by Jamaican BSL users for their own island of Jamaica. When talking more generally about the Caribbean, "WI" (for West Indies) is used. This is fingerspelled in the UK's two-handed form.

<P>I've become suspicious of attempts to use an indigenous sign for a
particular place or concept. Bearers of such fruits sometimes mis-remember
or misunderstand the context of the signs. One such example was the
introduction of the indigenous sign for "Russia" into BSL. A group of
Russians attended the British Deaf Association's congress in Brighton in
1990. Their sign for where they were from looked uncannily like the BSL for
"lie". In a matter of days the sign had mutated itself, reversing the
direction of motion until it looked more like the BSL "boy". That seemed
to make it acceptable in terms of BSL. It took several years before people
felt confident enough to use the original form.

<P>BSL currently uses a politically-correct sign for "China" which no Chinese
people recognise.

<P>I am looking forward to another flood of "foreign" signs into the UK, as
attendees at the WFD in Canada return. They'll be keen to impress us
stop-at-homes with their Citizen of the World personas! In amongst these
new sign will be lots of blunders.</DIR>
