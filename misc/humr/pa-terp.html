<P>I thought I saw a man brought to life
<BR>He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
<BR>He showed me what it was to cry
<BR>Well you couldn't be that man I adored
<BR>You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
<BR>I don't know him anymore
<BR>'Cause I don't care, I have no luck, I don't miss it all that much
<BR>There's just so many things thaT I can't touch, I'm torn
<BR>I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
<BR>I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
<BR>Illusion never changed into something real
<BR>I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
<BR>You're a little late, I'm already torn. torn.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/t.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter T" HEIGHT="75">wo years ago, I had my front tooth implanted. The process required that I wear a flipper - or removable false tooth - for 8 months (you can probably guess where this is going...). While interpreting a play one evening, I had to sneeze - there was no controlling it - and as I let her rip, my flipper went flying across the floor.Ê So I had to abandon my poor horrified partner to take over all the interpreting while I crawled across the floor, in the dark, searching for my flipper between the patrons' legs. I was not about to continue interpreting with the spotlight on me, with no front tooth. My ego strength is not THAT healthy... I'm happy to report that the gods and goddesses of The Interpreting World smiled down (with teeth, no doubt) upon me and I found the flipper quickly, popped it back in, and returned to my task. I endured some snickering from the audience, but overall, no one had a heart attack (except maybe my partner).

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/n.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter N" HEIGHT="75">ow I have to 'fess up to doing "something" while music was playing without words.  I interpreted for the "Day to be Gay" festival in Callacoon, NY, and there was a great comedy song called "Betty Boop and Buddha".  During the few moments of scat singing that occured three times between the verses and was reminiscient of the Roaring 20's (as was the music itself) I did the Charleston.  I admit it, and I will go to Interpreter Hell for it, but it was worth every second!

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75">nterpreting for musical theater, choral
performances, concerts, and the like, means that you're working for a
self-selected audience (visience?). They *want* to go see Pink, or the
Vienna Boys' Choir, or A Chorus Line. The music is an integral part of
the experience.
<P>Now, say, interpreter X is at an event where for some reason, they play
the theme from Star Trek (the original series with! All the! Bad...
acting!). Since the interpreter secretly wears Starfleet standard issue
 underoos, and refers to their Palm PDA as a "tricorder", they actually
know the lyrics...
<P>(See <A HREF="http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/trek1.htm">Urban legends reference pages: Unthemely behavior.</A>) 
<P>.... to the theme music (including the "bonus" disco version). The
interpreter offers a stirring rendition, even doing some cool flowy
song-sign thing.
<P>Bravissimi. Only thing is, terp X has actually detracted from the
event, since a re-hashing of Nichelle Nicole's rendition was not the
reason for the event in the first place.
<P>It's the same with this "Taps" thing. Assuming the facts as given were
essentially the way it happened, Taps was one element out of an entire
service dedicated to honoring those who had their lives snuffed out in
one ghastly, malevolent stroke. Interpreting little known, post hoc
words con-however-much-brio probably did not reflect the reason for
playing those twenty-two plaintive notes. A pretty smart guy once said,
"The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
it, far above our poor power to add or detract." Not bad words to
interpret by, in this case.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"> have been reading the discussions of interpreting music without words...
well at least presented without words whether there orginially were words
associated with the song or not.

<P>I had been thinking along the DeafBlind interpreting vien as well. I'm going
to relay a personal DB terping experience here. With a student that was
DeafBlind (totally blind, could hear enough that he LOVED music, though did
not have discrim for words spoken), there were times he would ask me to sign
the music. I tried to say, "Well, this doesnt have words, just music to it."
Eventually I wound up making motions that were not signs, but followed the
flow of the music to add a tactile sensation to the auditory he received. He
loved this and would ask for it from time to time. I definitely explained
that this was NOT interpreting of words, and that everyone interprets this
differently.

<P>Also interpreting music class with him was a challenge. ;o) The level between words, rhythm and such was an interesting mix to try to represent. He enjoyed this class, and also enjoyed playing instruments. He had rhythm and could apply it well. We developed our own little technique for all this. Luckily he is a smart kid and has fantastic memory skills! (side note -- he also will "sing" songs that he knows. Yes, the words are not formed perfectly, but he sings it as he hears it -- and with his new aids, his singing is improving!)

<P>There would be school assemblies with music, some with words, some without.
We also had the City Ballet come for performances; we took a field trip to
see the Nutcracker. This may seem kinda odd to many folks, but this was part
of his education. The Nutcracker experience was explained as the story --
different versions and such. When at the ballet, he received the visual
information that mostly focused on the story, interpreting what the
characters were doing, not so much how they were moving. When the ballet
comes to the school, they come and perform different pieces as well as talk
about values (teamwork, cultural diversity, that kind of thing). The spoken
message is conveyed, but also some descriptions takes place of the dancing as
well. 

<P>Before the assembly, we give the students (all deaf and the deafblind
student as well) a chance to check out ballet shoes, talk about movement,
etc. Some of this preconferencing comes in handy later with descriptions as
he can apply the information he just learned. Do I think he gets the same
experience the deaf children got visually? No. Do I think he got the same
experience of the hearing children that watched and listened? No. But I do
believe he was able to enjoy the music and find out more how people use their
body for self expression. This can ties into his IEP goals for movement, in
trying to have balance, transitions from one position to another (standing
from sitting, etc.) 

<P>With not experiencing sight he does not have the
experience of seeing how others move, and using that to apply to walking,
running, or things like that. Through regular times in PT, he has been
exposed to expectations, and they have been interpreted trying to tie in
classifiers that are comprehendable in tactile sign. Using these classifiers
while interpeting a dance, ties in some of those movements. We have also
taken it to the next level and taught him some basic dance. This works with
spatial awareness, awarenss of others (partner), rhythm (which can also be
used in the context of speech and reading), balance, coordination, etc.

<P>Now all of the things I have describe are about one child. I dont know how
this would apply to another DB child. Each person is different. :o)  Also
trying this with an adult is a different ballgame. By the time they are
adults, they have opionions about what they want and don't want in an
interpretation. If I can find those things out, then I will do the best to
match those expectations. When it comes to DB interpreting I don't feel
strange if there is a request to add motion to music. I dont feel strange
trying to describe the motion of dancers on a stage.

<P>To more specifically address the DeafWay experience with opening ceremonies
-- well I wasn't there, I had to rest after the long registration lines that
day! ha! But I do know there would be limitations to interpreting that
material if I looked at it as trying to convey the cultural meaning that came
from the performances. Frankly I don't have enough experience or knowledge
about all those varying cultures to be able to interpret that intent. The
best I could do was try to describe it. I'm sure that evening was difficult and
tiring!! My hats off to the DB interpreters and SSPs that worked so hard at
the conference!!!

<P>I find interpreting music is a touchy subject for many interpreters. There
are those that think music is a waste of time, others that think it is
vitally important, some that use it to show off, and some that hope they
never have to sign a song. I have also seen a lot of judgement from
interpreters about other interpreters on HOW an interpretation was done.
Personally, I like to watch others, and steal from them ;o) I get wonderful
material that way, and I also look at things with a different prespective!
Yes, I may have a preference for doing it another way, and some things I see
I don't like... but that still helps me anyalyze what I do and to challenge
myself to do a better job. 

<P>I don't do a LOT of music interpreting (aside from those dreaded assemblies with the middle school chorus that are not clear AT ALL!) But I do use music as a motivator, for me. I listen to music on the radio, then I try to think what does it mean, and how can I represent it. Doesn't make me a professional at it, but it does enhance my regular interpreting. It also gives me joy in tying the two worlds together for me. So therefore, I just do it for me if at all possible.
