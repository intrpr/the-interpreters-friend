<P>A certain man was infatuated with a young woman, but was so timid he never had the courage to speak to her. In fact, he told his therapist that every time he got near her he felt like nothing more than a tiny pebble. "Well," his therapist responded, "if you want to get the girl you'll just have to be a little boulder!"

<P>Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?

<PWhy is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?

<P>Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"?

<P>Why is the man who invests all your money called a "broker"?

<P>Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called "rush hour"?

<P>Why are they called "apartments" when they are all stuck together?

<P>If "con" is the opposite of "pro", is Congress the opposite of progress?

<P>If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the "terminal"?

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/g.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter G" HEIGHT="75"><B>ood thing you told me!</B>

<P>On a bar of Dial soap: "Directions: Use like regular soap." (and that would be how??...)

<P>On some Swanson frozen dinners: "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's "just" a suggestion.)

<P>On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): "Do not turn upside down." 

<P>On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding: "Product will be hot after heating." 

<P>On packaging for a Rowenta iron: "Do not iron clothes on body." 

<P>On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:"Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication." (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.)

<P>On Nytol Sleep Aid: "Warning: May cause drowsiness." 

<P>On most brands of Christmas lights: "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what?)

<P>On Sunsbury's peanuts: "Warning: contains nuts." 

<P>On an American Airlines packet of nuts: "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts." (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)

<P>On a Swedish chainsaw:"Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals." 
 
<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/t.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter T" HEIGHT="75"><B>he law of the conservation of consonants</B>
<P>The quantity of consonants in the English language is constant.  If omitted in one place, they turn up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks" his "cah", the lost r's migrate southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl wells."

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/d.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter D" HEIGHT="75"><B>EAR ABBY: He goes, "English is, like, a mess.  Right?"</B>
<P>Dear Abby: What has happened to the English language?  The excessive use and misuse of the word "like" is an abomination! To utter the incoherent, "I was, like, you know, going home," incriminates the user as does, "it was, like, Saturday."  "Like" is a substitute for "about", "approximately", "similar to", "it may have been", or many other terms or expressions.  And "I go" and "he goes" are stupid contortions for "I said, stated, noted, observed", and other correct usages.
<P>"Hopefully" is used far too often and invariably ungrammatically.  And athletes, especially, seem incapable of stumbling and fumbling through even a half sentence without a "hopefully".  This incorrect redundancy could be replaced with "I hope", "I would hope" or "we will attempt to".  The sports announcers are the worst.  We can surely do without the "hey" and "guys"  in every other sentence.  They are so infuriating, I turn them off and walk the dog.
<P><DIR>- Kenneth F. Emerick, Shippenvile, Pa.</DIR>
<P>Dear Kenneth: You have found a soul mate in Marcie Mitchell. Read on:
<P>Dear Abby: Will you please make another attempt to improve the atrocious and horrid misuse of our language? Much of it is inarticulate, appallingly sloppy and infuriating to the listener.  It is maddening to hear "you know, you know, you know" from so many of the celebrities and athletes interviewed on TV.
<P>One of the most annoying habits is ending every other sentence with "OK?"  Some people end every sentence with "RIght?"  I know you dealt with this problem several years ago, but it wouldn't hurt to print a reminder.

<P>These gaseous observations were made by junior high, high school and college students around the world.  It is truly astonishing what weird science our young scholars can create under the pressures of time and grades.  From test papers and essays submitted to science and health teachers, here is a dissertation of loopy, unscientific English:  (WWW)

<P>When you breath, you inspire.  When you do not breath, you expire.
<P>     H2O is hot water, and CO2  is cold water
<P>      To collect fumes of sulphur, hold a deacon over a flame in a test tube
<P>      When you smell an oderless gas, it is probably carbon monoxide
<P>      Nitrogen is not found in Ireland because it is not found in a free state
<P>      Water is composed of two gins, Oxygin and Hydrogin.  Oxygin is pure gin. Hydrogin is gin and water.
<P>      Three kinds of blood vessels are arteries, vanes and caterpillars.
<P>      Blood flows down one leg and up the other.
<P>      Respiration is composed of two acts, first inspiration, and then expectoration.
<P>      The moon is a planet just like the earth, only it is even deader.
<P>      Artificial insemination is when the farmer does it to the cow instead of the bull.
<P>      Dew is formed on leaves when the sun shines down on them and makes them perspire
<P>      A super saturated solution is one that holds more then is can hold.
<P>      Mushrooms always grow in damp places and so they look like umbrellas.
<P>      The body consists of three parts- the brainium, the borax and the abominable cavity.  The brainium contains the brain, the borax contains the heart and lungs, and the abominable cavity contains the bowls, of which there are five - a, e, i, o, and u.
<P>      The pistol of a flower is its only protections agenst insects.
<P>      The alimentary canal is located in the northern part of Indiana.
<P>      The skeleton is what is left after the insides have been taken out and the outsides have ben taken off.  The purpose of the skeleton is something to hitch meat to.
<P>      A permanent set of teeth consists of eight canines, eight cuspids, two molars, and eight cuspidors.
<P>      The tides are a fight between the Earth and moon.  All water tends towards the moon, because there is no water in the moon, and nature abhors a vacuum. I forget where the sun joins in this fight.
<P>      A fossil is an extinct animal.  The older it is, the more extinct it is.
<P>      Many women believe that an alcoholic binge will have no ill effects on the unborn fetus, but that is a large misconception.

<P>      Before giving a blood transfusion, find out if the blood is affirmative or negative.
<P>      To remove dust from the eye, pull the eye down over the nose.
<P>      For a nosebleed:  Put the nose much lower then the body until the heart stops.
<P>      For drowning:  Climb on top of the person and move up and down to make artificial perspiration.
<P>      For fainting:  Rub the person's chest or, if a lady, rub her arm above the hand instead.  Or put the head between the knees of the nearest medical doctor.
<P>      For snakebites:  Bleed the wound and rape the victim in a blanket for shock.
<P>      For dog bite:  put the dog away for several days.  If he has not recovered, then kill it.

<P>Some grade school teachers must agree with that, because they keep journals of amusing things their students have written in papers. Here are a few examples: 

<P>The future of "I give" is "I take."

<P>The inhabitants of Moscow are called Mosquitoes.

<P>A census taker is man who goes from house to house increasing the population.

<P>(Define H2O and CO2.) H2O is hot water and CO2 is cold water.

<P>A virgin forest is a forest where the hand of man has never set foot.

<P>The general direction of the Alps is straight up.

<P>A city purifies its water supply by filtering the water then forcing it through an aviator.

<P>Most of the houses in France are made of plaster of Paris.

<P>The people who followed the Lord were called the 12 opossums.

<P>The spinal column is a long bunch of bones. The head sits on the top and you sit on the bottom.

<P>We do not raise silk worms in the United States, because we get our silk from rayon. He is a larger worm and gives more silk.

<P>One of the main causes of dust is janitors.

<P>A scout obeys all to whom obedience is due and respects all duly constipated authorities.

<P>One by-product of raising cattle is calves.

<P>The four seasons are salt, pepper, mustard and vinegar.

<P>The climate is hottest next to the Creator.

<P>Oliver Cromwell had a large red nose, but under it were deeply religious feelings.

<P>The word trousers is an uncommon noun because it is singular at the top and plural at the bottom.

<P>Syntax is all the money collected at the church from sinners. 

<P>The blood circulates through the body by flowing down one leg and up the other.

<P>In spring, the salmon swim upstream to spoon.

<P>Iron was discovered because someone smelt it.

<P>In the middle of the 18th century, all the morons moved to Utah.

<P>A person should take a bath once in the summer, not so often in the winter.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/m.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter M" HEIGHT="75"><B>s-communication</B>

<P>The British Government's policy of socialized medicine has recently been broadened to include a service called "Proxy Fathers". Under the government plan, any married woman who is unable to become pregnant through the first five years of her marriage may request the service of a proxy father; a government employee who attempts to solve the couple's problem by impregnating the wife.

<P>The Smiths, a young couple, have no children and a proxy father is due to arrive. Leaving for work, Mr. Smith says, "I'm off. The government man should be here soon." Moments later a door-to-door baby photographer rings the bell...

<P>Ms Smith: "Good morning."

<P>Salesman: "Good morning, madam. You don't know me, but I've come to..."

<P>Ms Smith: "No need to explain, I've been expecting you."

<P>Salesman: "Really? Well, good. I've made a specialty of babies, especially twins."

<P>Ms Smith: "That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"

<P>Salesman: (Sitting) "Then you don't need to be sold on the idea?" 

<P>Ms Smith: "Don't concern yourself. My husband and I both agree this is the right thing to do."

<P>Salesman: "Well, perhaps we should get down to it."

<P>Ms Smith: (Blushing) "Just where do we start?"

<P>Salesman: "Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor allows the subject to really spread out."

<P>Ms Smith: "Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it hasn't worked for Harry and me."

<P>Salesman: "Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time, but if we try several locations and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results." In fact, my
business card says, 'I aim to please.'"

<P>Ms Smith: "Pardon me, but isn't this a little informal?"

<P>Salesman: "Madam, in my line of work, a man must be at ease and take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that."

<P>Ms Smith: "Don't I know! Have you had much success at this?"

<P>Salesman: (Opening his briefcase and finding baby pictures) "Just look at this picture. Believe it or not, it was done on top of a bus in downtown London."

<P>Ms Smith: "Oh, my!!"

<P>Salesman: "And here are pictures of the prettiest twins in town. They turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with."

<P>Ms Smith: "She was?"

<P>Salesman: "Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her down to Hyde Park to get the job done right. I've never worked under such impossible conditions. People were crowding around four and five
deep, pushing to get a good look."

<P>Ms Smith: "Four and five deep?"

<P>Salesman: "Yes and for more than three hours, too. The mother got so excited she started bouncing around, squealing and yelling at the crowd. I couldn't concentrate. I'm afraid I had to ask a couple
of men to restrain her. By that time darkness was approaching and I began to rush my shots. When the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment I just packed it all in."

<P>Ms Smith: "You mean they actually chewed on your, eh.., equipment?"

<P>Salesman: "That's right, but it's all in a day's work. I consider my work a pleasure. I've spent years perfecting my patented technique. Now take this baby, I shot this one in the front window of a big
department store."

<P>Ms Smith: "I just can't believe it."

<P>Salesman: "Well, madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work."

<P>Ms Smith: "TRIPOD?!?"

<P>Salesman: "Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my equipment on. It's much too heavy and unwieldy for me to hold while I'm shooting.  Ms Smith?...Ms Smith?...My word, she's fainted!"

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/l.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter L" HEIGHT="75">et's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor   
 ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English
 muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France.  Sweetmeats are   
 candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat. We take
 English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that
 quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is
 neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write
 but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?

<P>If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth?
 One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn't it
 seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a
 bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you
 call it? If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a
 vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?

<P>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an
 asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a
 play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have
 noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat
 chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?

<P>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house
 can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it
 out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented
 by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human
 race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars
 are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.
