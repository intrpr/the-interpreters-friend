<DL>

<P><DT>"Brother Harold was a deaf man."
<DD>Said the preacher with a tear,
<DT>"But today he's up in heaven,
<DD>And today he can hear.
<P><DT>"Brother Harold could not speak,
<DD>So he talked with his hands,
<DT>But today he speaks with God,
<DD>And at last, God understands.
<P><DT>"Brother Harold was a sinner,
<DD>Like the rest of us," he screamed.
<DT>"But no longer is he silent,
<DD>For his sins have been redeemed."
<P><DT>And the people in the chapel
<DD>Who prayed for his soul
<DT>Rejoiced at the conviction
<DD>That Harold was now whole.
<P><DT>But as I sat among the mourners
<DD>And recalled the Dad I knew,
<DT>I asked myself this question:
<DD>"Is this message really true?
<P><DT>"Are deaf folks simply hearing folks
<DD>Whose ears do not perform?
<DT>Are women just like men
<DD>Except for function and for form?
<P><DT>"Are black folks just like white folks
<DD>But for the color of their skin?
<DT>Are all of us the same
<DD>If we but look deep within?
<P><DT>"Or is each of us unique
<DD>In what we are and what we give?
<DT>Aren't our differences our strengths?"
<DD>Let me share what I believe.
<P><DT>I believe if there's a heaven
<DD>It's a place not so very far
<DT>Where our differences are valued
<DD>And we're accepted as we are.
<P><DT>And I believe if there's a God,
<DD>He or She understands,
<DT>For He listens with his heart,
<DD>And He talks with his hands.

<DL>
<P><DT>Gather 'round, sweet butterflies.
<DD>Let your wings take peaceful rest.
<DT>Gather 'round, watch the master
<DD>Warm the air with her caress.
<DIR><P><DT>Watch the words flow so smoothly
<DD>From her hands with artful grace;
<DT>Watch the grammar form so neatly
<DD>In the contours of her face.
<DIR><P><DT>Watch her eyes move so quickly
<DD>As they reach into her soul
<DT>And reflect deepest meanings
<DD>In the wisdom that unfolds.
<DIR><P><DT>Watch and learn, sweet butterflies;
<DD>Remember well what you've seen
<DT>If you wish to write poems
<DD>With the rhythms of your wings.
<DIR><P><DT>Watch and learn from the master
<DD>How a sonnet can be seen
<DT>In the patterns of your flights
<DD>And the rhythm of your wings.

<P>After I had lunch in liquid form one day [during the LA CODA Conference], there was a call for a woman who is "good with her hands" to judge the men's hairiest chest contest.  Well, being a fan of furry guys, I volunteered right away and yes, I admit I claimed my interpreting expertise as a qualification for being judge.  I judged well, too.  I even got a cheap-gold-ship-on-a-stick trophy to prove it!  Can't wait to see the video from the hairy man contest.  (I was blindfolded the whole time.)
<P>Does this mean I have to turn in my certification or does this make me a candidate for a specialist certificate?

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">ne little joke that my kids would play on me and it happened twice.  I would
be sitting in my beloved chair, reading the newspaper.  The kids would be near
by, playing with their toys.  They would watch me and slowly lower their
voice. Assuming that my batteries may be getting weaker, I would turn up the volume.   The kids kept lowering their voices and I kept turning it up.  After about 5 minutes the kids would raise their voices and say, "HI YA, DAD!!!"  Talk about jumping to the ceiling like a fraidy cat!!  First, I thought I was hanging upside down from the ceiling then I check my pant to see if I wet them.  I manage to catch my breath and check my heart to see if it was still there.  The kids got away with it but I did let them know that I did not
like that.
