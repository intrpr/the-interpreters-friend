I was crossing with an intellectually challenged coworker of mine. She asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when the light is red. Appalled, she responded, "What on earth are blind people doing driving?"

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">ne day, a guy came to the forest started chopping down a tree. He chopped for a while, then he yelled "Timber!", but the tree wouldn't fall; it just stayed there. He tried yelling timber again. Still it wouldn't fall. So he said. "Hmmm, oh, I've got an idea." He went to school and learned some sign language. He went back, tapped on the tree's bark, and fingerspelled "T-I-M-B-E-R" and finally the tree fell to the ground. You see, it was a deaf tree. It didn't work the next week, though, until he fingerspelled it by pressing each letter against its bark. That tree was deaf-blind.

<P>People who use their eyes to receive information about the world are called "sighted people" or "people who are sighted." "Legal sight" means any visual acuity greater than 20/200 in the better eye without correction ort an angle of vision wider than 20 degrees. Sighted people enjoy rich full lives working, playing and raising families. The run business, hold public office and teach your children!

<P><B><U>How do sighted people get around?</U></B>

<P>People who are sighted my walk or ride public transportation, but most choose to travel long distances by operating their own motor vehicles. They have gone through many hours of training to learn the "rules of the road" in order to further their independence.  Once that road to freedom has been mastered, sighted people earn a legal classification and a "driver's license" which allows the to operate a private vehicle safely and independently.

<P><B><U>How to assist a sighted person</U></B>

<P>Sighted people are accustomed to viewing the world in visual terms. This means that in many situations,  they will not be able to communicate orally and may resort to pointing ort other gesturing.  Subtle facial expression may also be used to convey feelings in social situations. Calmly alert the sighted person to his surroundings by speaking slowly, in a normal tone of voice.

<P>Questions directed at the sighted person help focus attention back to the verbal rather than visual communication.

<P>At times, sighted people may need help finding things, especially when operating a motor vehicle.  Your advanced knowledge of routes and landmarks, particularly bumps in the road, turns and traffic lights, will assist the "driver" in finding the way quickly and easily. Your knowledge of building layouts can also assist the sighted person in navigating complex shopping malls and offices. Sighted people tend to be very proud and will not ask directly for assistance. Be gentle yet firm.

<P><B><U>How do sighted people use computers?</U></B>

<P>The person who is sighted relies exclusively on visual information. His or her attention span fades quickly when reading long tests. Computer information is presented in a "graphical user interface" or GUI.  Coordination of hands and eyes is often a problem for sighted people, so the computer mouse, a handy device that slides along the desk top, saves confusing keystrokes. With one button, the sighted person can move around his or her computer screen quickly and easily. People who are sighted are not accustomed to synthetic speech and may have great difficulty understanding even the clearest synthesizer. Be patient and prepare to explain many times how your computer equipment works.

<P><B><U>How do sighted people read?</U></B>

<P>Sighted people read through a system called "Print." This is a series of images drawn in a tow dimensional plane. People who are sighted generally have a poorly developed sense of touch. Braille is completely foreign to the sighted person and he or she will take longer to learn the code and be severely limited by his or her existing visual senses.  Sighted people cannot function well in low lighting conditions and are generally completely helpless in total darkness. Their homes are usually very brightly lit at great expense, as are businesses that cater to the sighted consumer.

<P><B><U>How can I support a sighted person?</U></B>

<P>People who are sighted do not want your charity. They want to live, work and play along with you. The best thing you can do to support sighted people in your community is to open yourself to their world, These American are vital contributing members to society. Take a sighted person to lunch today!

<P>Whenever I skedaddle 
<BR>up stairwells
<BR>or dive down flights,
<BR>swooping past risers,
<BR>I want to touch down
<BR>on each landing standing
<BR>with my tango partner.

<BR>to become a sword,
<BR>parrying lunges from poles
<BR>and challenging anything
<BR>in my way,
<BR>unafraid of ambushes
<BR>of concrete and glass.

<P>Whenever I approach seas
<BR>of feet, I want her
<BR>to wave her slender figure,
<BR>luminous white,
<BR>for the sea before me
<BR>to part and make way
<BR>for a man possessed.

<P>One day while walking home form work, a light yellow Volkswagen pulled over to pick me up.  I thought to myself, "Oh goody, Larry is picking me up!" Larry was the fellow I was dating at that time.  I hopped into the car and looked at the driver and said, "Hi Larry!" My jaw dropped ten feet below and I said to the driver, "I don't know you!" and started to get out of the car very quickly.  The driver said to me, "No, wait a minute! I know you!" It turned out he knew me from attending the same college as I did and he had a huge crush on me. He told me that I ignored him whenever he said "Hi!" to me.  (As you know I didn't ignore him; I didn't hear him!) He recognized me and pulled over to try once more to say hello to me. And that's how I met my husband!

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/w.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter W" HEIGHT="75">hen I was 22 years old, I had a nice date with a hearing-sighted lady who was a Coda (child of deaf adults). She and I went to see a performance of The National Theater of the Deaf.  When we got inside, we sat down and enjoyed the show. I was teasing the lady by flirting. At first, I didn't know she got up and left for some reason (I think other deaf people got her attention). When I felt her seat was empty, I thought she moved slightly from me as I knew she was teasing me, too. So I moved a little bit closer, and flirted with her. But when the light came on suddenly, I looked at the next seat and gasped - it was a guy giving me strange, startled looks. I apologized to him saying I thought it was her, but it ended up like that. He gave me wild looks and his jaw dropped. I gasped and my face turned bright red. Then the lady came back, and laughed and laughed at the way I looked!

<P>A DeafDigest subscriber, residing in Illinois, said he spotted a
sign at the local McDonalds, saying they have special menus for the
deaf.  Curious, this subscriber who is hard of hearing, decided to give it
a try. He went to the drive in window counter and asked for a "deaf
menu." The person behind the window immediately gave him a Braille
menu!  "Well," said the hard of hearing subscriber "How many Blind patrons
drive up to the take-out window?"

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/c.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter C" HEIGHT="75"><B>ool fact</B>

<P>Helen Keller (1880-1968), blind and deaf from an early age, developed her sense of smell so finely that she could identify friends by their personal odors.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"><B>f I hear the old "nature compensates" line, one more time. . .</B> 

<P>A doctor was explaining to a patient how nature sometimes compensates for a persons deficiencies. "For example," he told him, "If a man is deaf, he may have keener sight, and if a man is blind, he may have a keen sense of smell."
<P>"I think I see what you mean," said the patient, "I've often noticed that if a man has one short leg, then the other one is always longer....."

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">n a visit to the library I happened to notice a man and a woman, both deaf, signing with intense gestures, apparently in a heated debate. The man said something, and the woman seemed upset. She started signing her reply very fast, to the point where the man couldn't understand a word; she also signed in big, wide gestures, which is the equivalent of volume. Finally, looking strained, her companion took her hands, "silencing" her. The he signed, very small and slowly, "You don't have to shout, I'm not blind." 

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">ne day  at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner were seated, waiting for the cockpit crew to show up so they can get under way.  The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane, and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle.  Both appear to be blind.  The pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle, and the copilot is using a guide dog.  Both have their eyes covered with huge sunglasses.  At first the passengers do not react, thinking it must be some sort of practical joke.
<P>However, after a few minutes the engines start revving and the airplane starts moving down the runway.  The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness, whispering among themselves and looking  desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.
<P>Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin panicking.  Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.  Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once, and at the very last moment the airplane lifts off and is airborne.
<P>Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to the pilot and signs: "You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we're gonna get killed!"

<P>It appears everyone dreams.  They tend to dream according to what they are able to do in their minds.  I know friends who dream about racing dots (of braille) and canes escaping, attacking, doing crazy things.
<P>I also dream things from the world of the deaf-blind: I had this "verbometer" counting how many words per second the speaker was going.  He hit 180 wpm and I gave a "speeding ticket".  His penaly? To say <sorry> one thousand times in two minutes flat!
<P>I dreamed my intervenor (interpreter for deaf-blind) had her fingers "burnt" to stubs talking to me.
<P>I dreamed once that a braille book caught fire because I was reading too fast: friction!
<P>One friend dreamed that his cane turned into a serpent and bit him; he was poisoned! . . . etc.

First, she took his card, read it carefully, and then offered her arm.  They walked across the street slowly
and then the lady left the DB guy.  He suddenly realized that the lady still
had his card so he yelled and yelled, but to no avail so he tried to run
after her, yelling "Hey, you still have my card!" and the lady still walked
on.  Finally one of the pedestrians grabbed the lady's arm.  Poor lady was
scared out of her wits because she was very hard of hearing.  She returned
the card to the DB guy and he, feeling sorry for her, decided to treat her to
a cup of coffee.  Soon after that, they became very good friends.

<P>A  rolled up newspaper can be an effective training tool when used
properly. For instance, use the rolled-up newspaper if your dog chews
something or has a housebreaking accident. Take the rolled-up newspaper
and hit yourself over the head as you repeat the phrase,
    
<P>"I  FORGOT  TO  WATCH MY DOG,  I  FORGOT TO WATCH  MY  DOG."

<P>This is the only time a rolled-up newspaper should be used in training.
If your dog laughs at you when you do this, praise him.
