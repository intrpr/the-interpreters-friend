<P><IMG SRC="../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="golden marble bullet">While visiting London for 6 weeks to learn BSL, my generoushost Roger Beeson, a BSL interpreter, encouraged me to read <I>Watching the English: The hidden rules of English behavior</I> by Kate Fox. In the section on "pub-talk", she reports a conversation between two regular customers and a publican (the keeper of a pub[lic house]) as follows:

<P>"Regular 1: 'Where's meat and two veg, then?'
<BR>Publican: 'Dunno, should be here by now.'
<BR>Regular 2: 'Must be doing a Harry!'
<BR><I>( - All laugh - )</I>
<BR>Regular 1: 'Put one in the wood for him, then - and yourself?'
<BR>Publican: 'I'll have one for Ron then, thanks.'"

<P>She goes on to explain the meaning of this intimate discourse: "To decode this conversation, you would need to know that the initial question about 'meat and two veg' was not a request for a meal, but an enquiry as to the whereabouts of another regular called 'meat and two veg' because of his rather stolid, conservative nature (meat with two vegetables being the most traditional, unadventerous English meal). Such witty nicknames are common: In another pub, there is a regular known as TLA, which stands for Three Letter Acronym, because of his penchant for business-school jargon. 

<P>One would also have to know that 'doing a Harry', in this pub, is code for 'getting lost', Harry being another regular, a somewhat absent minded man, who once, three years ago, managed to get lost on his way to the pub, and is still teased about the incident. 'Put one in the wood for him' is a local version of a more common pub-talk expression, meaning 'reserve a pint of beer for him, when he arrives', which I will pay for now'... The phrase 'and yourself?' is shorthand for 'and one for yourself?', the approved formula for offering a drink. The 'Ron' referred to by the publican, however, is not a person, but a contraction of 'later on'.

<P>There is a two letter word that perhaps has more meaning than any other
two letter word  it's UP. It's easy to understand UP, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we waken in the morning, why do we wake UP? At a meeting, why does a topic come UP? Why do we speak UP and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP to the secretary to write UP a report? We call UP our friends, we use it to brighten UP a room, polish UP the silver, wewarm UP the leftovers and clean UP the kitchen. We lock UP the house and some guys fix UP the old car. At other times the little word has real special meaning. People stir UP trouble, line UP for tickets, work UP an appetite, and think UP excuses. To be dressed is one thing but to be dressed UP is special, and this is confusing. A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP. We open UP a store in the morning but we close it UP at night. 
<P>We seem to be pretty mixed UP about UP. To be knowledgeable of the proper uses of UP, look UP the word in the dictionary. In a desk size dictionary, UP takes UP almost 1/4th the page and definitions add UP to about thirty. If you are UP to it, you might trybuilding UP a list of the many ways UP is used. It will take UP a lot of your time, but if you don't give UP, you may wind UP with a hundred or more. When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding UP. When it doesn't rain for a while, things dry UP. One could go on and on, but I'll wrap it UP, for now my time is UP, so I'll shut UP.

<P>In promulgating your esoteric cogitations, or articulating your superficial sentimentalities and amicable, philosophical or psychological observations, beware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let your conversational communications possess a clarified conciseness, a compacted comprehensibleness, coalescent consistency, and a concatenated cogency. Eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity, jejune babblement, and asinine affectations. 

<P>Let your extemporaneous descantings and unpremeditated expatiations have intelligibility and veracious vivacity, without rodomontade or thrasonical bombast. Sedulously avoid all polysyllabic profundity, pompous prolixity, psittaceous vacuity ventriloquial verbosity, and vaniloquent vapidity. Shun double-entendres, prurient jocosity, and pestiferous profanity, obscurant or apparent!! And, don't teach with big words! 

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"><B> say.</B> Say what?  It can be socially disastrous for Americans and the British to visit each other's countries without carrying a table of phrase equivalents. That's because they use the same words and phrases to describe different things.
<P>For example, the Brits wear "vests" under their shirts. Their vests are what the Yanks call "undershirts." Americans wear suspenders to hold up their pants, while in Britain suspenders push back one's teeth (the equivalent of the American "braces").
<P>My favorite is the American "orchestra seats," which offer a close-up view of a play or concert. In Britain you would be sitting in the "stalls,"
something that Americans sitting in orchestra seats would repair to at intermission, or whenever nature calls.

<!--Keep the entries above and below this together-->
<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75">n response the Bernie Smith's comments, Hilary Seymour wrote me and said:
<P>"I've just come to a piece on the 'Crazy English Language' page though - The Joy of Trivia by Bernie Smith.  Very funny and mostly true - one small correction though - 'Americans wear suspenders to hold up their pants, while in Britain suspenders push back one's teeth (the equivalent of the American "braces").'  No no no.  In Britain, Suspenders are what women use to hold up their stockings!  The writer is getting confused, because what you call suspenders, WE call braces, as well as braces being the things that push teeth back (which I thought Americans called retainers?!) - all very confusing!  I know it wasn't you who wrote that piece, but thought maybe you might want to add the correction anyway.
<P>Thanks for entertaining me!"

<P>[Editor's note: So much fun is poked at the bizarre aspects of English on this page, I thought it only fair to include an article that shows its usefulness as well.]

<P><P>Despite the protests of nationalists in Switzerland, France, Russia and other
countries, English is steadily gaining ground as the world's new lingua
franca. Is this globalization of language the first step toward obsolescence
of our industry or merely business as usual?

<P>ENGLISH ADVANCE UNSTOPPABLE? While some folks are concerned that the growing
use of English will threaten what's left of national identities in European
countries, most Europeans welcome the use of a single language. In one
European Union (EU) survey, 70% of those polled agreed with the proposition
that "everyone should speak English." In some European countries, English is
even regarded as a second national language.

<P>Switzerland, the poster child for multilingual societies, has become the
latest battleground in the war over the language's dominance. According to
reports in <I>The New York Times</I> and <I>The Economist</I>, some schools in Switzerland
are now teaching English as a primary language before another one of the
country's four official languages.

<P>Maybe this is not a big surprise: the Swiss have a long history of using
English to bridge language gaps. The Swiss advertising industry, for instance,
relies heavily on English words and phrases to advertise Swiss products in all
parts of Switzerland. It is estimated that 30% of all Swiss magazine ads use
English, usually in a prominent position.

<P>But it's not just English words and phrases that are being borrowed by other
languages. In Italy, some members of parliament are concerned that the real
damage is through the "colonization of syntax" and have issued a manifest to
defend the Italian language.

<P>MODERN COLONIALISM. Neither side in this debate shies away from strong
language. The <I>British Guardian Weekly</I> in 2001 ran several articles on "the
global English debate." In decrying the EU policy of linguistic equality and
multilingualism as "ineffective and hypocritical," one author argued that
these policies have been maintained largely because "the French with their
traditionally superior position in Europe cannot accept the decline of their
own linguistic power" and, to a lesser degree, because "powerful translators'
lobbies fight for their raison d'être."

<P>To anybody in the language business, the existence of a strong lobby is big
news. Where can we find this lobby? But I digress.

<P>France is the country that is best known for efforts to prevent English from
diluting its national language. But despite government mandates, English has
still crept into everyday use there. English computer and business terms in
particular are often used over their French equivalents.

<P>French purists take solace in the fact that they're not fighting this battle
alone. Concerned that an invasion of foreign slang is corrupting the Russian
language, the State Duma is considering a legislative crackdown. A bill
drafted by the majority United Russia Party aims to corral the wandering
Russian language and purge it of foreign and alien elements that have been
picked up during the loose years since the Soviet Union's collapse.

<P>ENGLISH AS BINDING AGENT. These language purification efforts run into the
widespread belief that English is essential to doing business around the
world. According to Global Business, the use of English in Hong Kong has
declined sharply since the British returned the territory to China in 1997.
This alarms business leaders and citizens alike who believe that, in order to
continue attracting multinational corporations, English use must remain strong
in the region.

<P>The importance of English as the language of global commerce has led many
global companies, including Nokia and Alcatel, to adopt English as their
official operating language. Even at the United Nations, English is now the
language of choice: when member nations were asked to name the language in
which all correspondence to their missions should be addressed, the
overwhelming majority chose English.

<P>By communicating in English, organizations are able to be inclusive rather
than exclusive. For example, e-mail threads often spread throughout
organizations; and if the language shifts from Spanish to German to Italian,
lots of people will be left out.

<P>OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS. just as Latin steamrolled its way across Europe 2,000
years ago, crushing local languages in its path. so English has become the
lingua franca of our times. Does this mean that the translation industry is on
its way to becoming obsolete?

<P>As an ever-increasing proportion of the global population can communicate in
English, the need for some language service (interpreting, for instance)
decreases. But this enhanced ability to communicate with others goes hand in
hand with the globalization of trade.

<P>In fact, never before has the demand for quality translation and localization
services been so great. Companies and individuals who can offer real value to
their clients will enjoy boom times for years to come, Far from being just one
more nail in the coffin of the translation industry, the globalization of
language presents us with unparalleled opportunities for growth and success.

                            Never guess, it is not safe;

                            (Make these rhyme with "cuff" and "cow"). 
                        Seven is right, but so is even, 
                        Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen. 
                            Monkey, donkey, clerk but jerk; 
                            Asp, grasp, wasp, demesne, cork, work. 
                        Say serene but sirene. Psyche 
                        must be made to rhyme with "spiky". 
                            It's a dark abyss or tunnel,

                            Hiccough has the sound of "cup" -

When they met a deadline successfully she said, "Let's have a knees-up!"  Everyone looked at each other and started to roar!  My hands stopped in mid-motion, searching my memory banks for what that might mean.  Afterwards they asked her what she meant.  A "knees-up" is a party (not the kind of gathering the workers had imagined).  When asekd for an explanation she said she thought it had something to do with dancing.

<P>Stewardesses and reverberated are the two longest words (12 letters
each) that can be typed using only the left hand. The longest word that
can be typed using only the right hand is lollipop. Skepticisms is the
longest word that alternates hands. [Burrell Gluskin adds: Sorry, and for the left hand alone what about aftereffects and desegregated? And, of course, sweaterdresses and tesseradecades  (a period of forty years). For the right hand alone,  your list should contain  polyphony and homophony and kinnikinnick (an Indian ceremonial food) and hypolimnion  (deep lake water). For both hands please consider antiskepticism, leucocytozoans (bird parasites) and dismantlement.]

<P>A group of geese on the ground is a gaggle, a group of geese in the air
is a skein.  The underside of a horse's hoof is called a frog.  The frog peels off several times a year with new growth.

<P>The combination "ough" can be pronounced in nine different ways. The
following sentence contains them all: "A rough-coated, dough-faced,
thoughtful ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough; after
falling into a slough, he coughed and hiccoughed. [Burrell Gluskin adds: There are actually twenty-eight different pronunciations of 'OUGH" of which ten  are common words: borough, tough, hiccough, nought, bough, trough, though, ought, cough, through. The other eighteen are uncommon and some are obsolete and/or 
dialectical.]

<P>The only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a letter
is uncopyrightable. [Burrell Gluskin comments: Oops! What about dermatoglyphics (prints of the hands and feet)?]

<P>Facetious and abstemious contain all the vowels in the correct order, as
does arsenious, meaning "containing arsenic." [Burrel Gluskin adds: abstentiously (self restrained), facetiously, annelidously, and
caesious (dark blue). Finally, if one is permitted to use a hyphenated word, "gathering-ground" could be added to the list.]

<P>The word 'pound' is abbreviated 'lb.' after the constellation 'libra'
because it means 'pound' in Latin, and also 'scales'. The abbreviation
for the British Pound Sterling comes from the same source: it is an 'L'
for libra/Lb. with a stroke through it to indicate abbreviation.
Same goes for the Italian lira which uses the same abbreviation ('lira'
coming from 'libra'). So British currency (before it went metric) was
always quoted as "pounds/shillings/pence", abbreviated "L/s/d" [Burrell Gluskin comments: Okay. But what about oz. for ounce?]

<P>The only nation who's name begins with an "A", but doesn't end in an "A"
is Afghanistan.

pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust. [Burrell Gluskin comments: Well, sort of. This word is actually a hoax perpetrated by the members of the National Puzzlers' League, the world's oldest wordplay association. The word is unknown to medical science. The League President (Everett M. Smith) coined the word at the 103rd meeting of the League,  held  on February 22, 1935 in New York City. It was picked up by a newspaper reporter for the HeraldTribune and printed the next day in the headline of an article on the League meeting.  Frank Scully,  author of a series of puzzle books and later one of the early UFO enthusiasts, read the newspaper article and repeated the word in Bedside Manna; The Third Fun in Bed Book (Simon and Schuster, 1936, p.87). On the strength of this citation, League members (with a wink from the editors?) got the word into both the OED Supplement and Webster's Third. And it is still there!]

 vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?

<P> Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an
 asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a
 play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have
 noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat
 chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?

<P> You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house
 can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it
 out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented
 by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human
 race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars
 are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.

<P>How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another.
Have you noticed that we talk about certain things only when they are
absent?  Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown  Met a
sung hero or experienced requited love?  Have you ever run into someone
who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable?  And where are all
those people who ARE spring chickens or would ACTUALLY hurt a fly?

<P>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house
can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it
out, and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.  Why is "crazy
man" and insult, while to insert a comma and say, "crazy, man!" is a
compliment (as when applauding a jazz performance.)

<P>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the
creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all).
That is why, when the stars are out, the are visible, but when the lights
are out, they are invisible.  Any why, when I wind up my watch, I start
it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it.

inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no
feelings whatsoever when we're apart. I can be forever happy--will you
let me be yours?
