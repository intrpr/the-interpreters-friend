We are using monkey language!!! Hoooh heeh hoo-hooo-hooooouuuu heee!!! You got a problem with that?? Hooh hooh???" The old couple looked embarrassed and quickly ran away.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"> know a pair of Deaf twins.  When they were babies, the teachers and doctors
told their mother (a single parent) not to sign to them.  But these bright
little boys spontaneously and naturally developed a signed language of their
own.  They didn't invent a sign language because they were naughty, stupid, or
snobbish.  These little tykes just wanted to talk to each other, and they
started doing it as naturally as trees grow leaves.  They were apparently sent
to at least one fine oral program, but they were not successful there.  Later
they were sent to a signing program, and they learned to sign like other deaf
people . . . sometimes straight ASL, sometimes signs with some features of
English grammar, and sometimes a type of signed English with lots of "invented"
(to represent English words) signs.  They are middle-aged now.  And when they
are talking only to each other, they still might use their first language, and
nobody else on earth can understand them.  And nobody who truly loves them
would ask them to talk to each other any differently.
