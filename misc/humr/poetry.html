Oh, hmmm, how do I explain that? <P>Simply, I can't hear. <DIR>Nooo, it is much more than that. <P>It is similar to a goldfish in a bowl. <P>Always observing things going on. <P>People talking all the time. <P>It is being a man on his own island <P>Among foreigners. </DIR>Isolation is no stranger to me. <P>Relatives say hi and bye. <P>But I sit for five hours among them. <P>Talking great pleasure at amusing babies. <P>Reading books, resting, helping out with food. <DIR>Natural curiosity perks up <P>Upon seeing great laughter, crying, upsetness. <P>Inquire only to meet with "Never mind", <P>"Oh, it is not important," <P>Getting such a summarized statement <P>of whole story. </DIR>Supposed to smile to show the happiness. <P>Little do they know how truly miserable I am. <P>People are in control of language usage, <P>I am at loss and real uncomfortable! </DIR>Always feeling of being an outsider <P>Among the hearing people <P>Even if it was not their intention. <P>Always assume that I am part of them <P>By my physical presence, not understanding <P>The importance of communication. <DIR>Facing the choice between the Deaf Camping <P>Weekend and Family Reunion. <P>Facing the choice between the family commitment <P>And Deaf friends, <P>I must make the choice constantly, <P>Any wonder why I choose Deaf friends??? </DIR>I get such great pleasure at Deaf Clubs, <P>Before I realized, it is already 2 a.m., <P>Whereas I anxiously look at the clock <P>Every few minutes in the family reunion. <DIR>With Deaf people, I am so normal, <P>Our communication flows back and forth, <P>Catching up with little trivials, our daily life, <P>Our frustration in the bigger world, <P>Seeking the mutual understanding, </DIR>Contented smiles, and laughing are musical. <P>So magical to me <P>So attuned to each other's feelings. <P>Truly happiness so important. <DIR>I feel more at home with Deaf people <P>Of various color, religious, short or tall, <P>Then I do among my own hearing relatives. <P>And wonder why? <P>Our language is common. <P>We understand each other. </DIR>Being at loss in control <P>Of environment, that is, communication, <P>People panic and retreat to avoidance, <P>Deaf people are like plague. <DIR>But Deaf people are still human beings <P>With dreams, desires and needs <P>Of belong just like everyone else. <P><DIR>- Dianne Switras</DIR></DIR>

<P>I've been watching you watching the
<BR>interpreter. She is just to the left of 
<BR>the speaker, and always slightly behind
<BR>so that you are always slightly behind
<BR>too, your face registering surprise
<BR>when the surprise has already been,
<BR>your smile on the heels of the other smiles,
<BR>your laugh coming after the wave of
<BR>laughter subsides. I love the lag time, the
<BR>pause between word and sign, the  space
<BR>between signifier and signifier and signified.
<BR>I want to slip inside that space and sit
<BR>across from you, legs crossed, hands
<BR>folded in my lap. If I make myself very
<BR>small, inconspicuous, insignificant as
<BR>another pair of antennae on the wall,
<BR>just watching you, quietly, watching the
<BR>interpreter, could I, could we, fit?

<P>Deaf don't name names.
<BR>Not the way Hearing do.
<BR>Face to face, what need for names?
<BR>Me to you, hey will do.
<P>Hearing eyes say hey is rude,
<BR>hey is talking out of turn.
<BR>Deaf say Hearing eyes are rude

<P>Me to you, between us two,

<P>Gather 'round, sweet butterflies.
<BR>Let your wings take peaceful rest.
<BR>Gather round, watch the master
<BR>Warm the air with her caress.
	
<P>Watch the words flow so smoothly
<BR>From her hands with artful grace;
<BR>Watch the grammar form so neatly
<BR>In the contours of her face.
		
<P>Watch her eyes move so quickly 
<BR>As they reach into her soul
<BR>And reflect deepest meanings
<BR>In the wisdom that unfolds.
			
<P>Watch and learn, sweet butterflies;
<BR>Remember well what you've seen
<BR>If you wish to write poems
<BR>With the rhythm of your wings.
				
<P>Watch and learn from the master
<BR>How a sonnet can be seen
<BR>In the patterns of your flights
<BR>And the rhythms of your wings.

<P>In the Deaf world Deaf
<BR>is good. That's the premise
<BR>that sets the Deaf world
<BR>apart. So when the audiologist says
<BR>to two Deaf parents,
<BR>"I'm sorry, your baby
<BR>is profoundly deaf," they do not
<BR>weep or mourn or
<BR>blame themselves or
<BR>God. They rejoice.
<BR>They embrace each other and even
<BR>the confused audiologist who
<BR>is the bearer of great
<BR>tidings. Healthy Deaf babies
<BR>are good, the more the better.
<BR>Deaf brothers, Deaf sisters,
<BR>Deaf mothers and fathers
<BR>confer considerable status
<BR>in the Deaf world. Deaf
<BR>families are a kind of
<BR>Deaf aristocracy
<BR>where Deaf is the currency.
<BR>Deaf grandmothers and grandfathers,
<BR>Deaf aunts and uncles, Deaf nieces
<BR>and nephews and cousins and more
<BR>Deaf cousins. There are even
<BR>some who are third or fourth
<BR>or fifth generation Deaf.
<BR>These are the Deaf royalty.
<BR>Sometimes you can see them
<BR>surrounded by dilating circles
<BR>of envious, awestruck, Deaf eyes
<BR>just listening to the stories
<BR>told in elegant, flowing ASL--
<BR>stories of family trees
<BR>hearkening all the way back to the first
<BR>Deaf community on Martha's Vineyard,
<BR>or maybe back to the very first
<BR>school for the Deaf in Paris, France;
<BR>to Laurent Clerc and his teacher
<BR>Jean Massieu and his teacher
<BR>the Abbe Sicard who wasn't deaf himself
<BR>but who nearly lost his head when the heads
<BR>of the aristocrats and clergy
<BR>began to roll in the streets.
<BR>But he didn't lose his head, and it was only
<BR>because the Deaf of Paris loved him
<BR>enough to write a letter
<BR>to the authorities on his behalf
<BR>in elegant,  flowing, flawless French,
<BR>calling him their father and their teacher,
<BR>and winning his release.

<P>"Brother Harold was a deaf man,"
<DIR>Said the preacher with a tear,</DIR>
<BR>"But today he's up in heaven,
<DIR>And today he can hear.</DIR>
	
<P>"Brother Harold could not speak,
<DIR>So he talked with his hands,</DIR>
<BR>But today he speaks with God,
<DIR>And at last, God understands.</DIR>
	
<P>"Brother Harold was a sinner,
<DIR>Like the rest of us," he screamed.</DIR>
<BR>But no longer is he silent,
<DIR>For his sins have been redeemed."</DIR>
 	
<P>And the people in the chapel
<DIR>Who prayed for his soul</DIR>
<BR>Rejoiced at the conviction
<DIR>That Harold was now whole.</DIR>
 	
<P>But as I sat among the mourners
<DIR>And recalled the Dad I knew</DIR>
<BR>I asked myself the question:
<DIR>"Is this message really true?</DIR>
 	
<P>"Are deaf folks simply hearing folks
<DIR>Whose ears do not perform?</DIR>
<BR>Are women just like men
<DIR>Except for function and for form?</DIR>
 	
<P>"Are black folks just like white folks
<DIR>But for the color of their skin?</DIR>
<BR>Are all of us the same
<DIR>If we but look deep within?</DIR>
 	
<P>"Or is each of us unique
<DIR>In what we are and what we give?</DIR>
<BR>Aren't our differences our strengths?"
<DIR>Let me share what I believe.</DIR>
 	
<P>I believe if there's a heaven
<DIR>It's a place not so very far</DIR>
<BR>Where our differences are valued
<DIR>And we're accepted as we are.</DIR>
 	
<P>And I believe if there's a God.
<DIR>He or She understands,</DIR>
<BR>For He listens with his heart,
<DIR>And he talks with his hands.</DIR>

<P>What does it mean
<BR>that the thumb of this poem
<BR>drags its pink nail
<BR>down over the closed
<BR>mouth of this poem?
<BR>Is it in pain?
<BR>Can it not speak?
<BR>Is this prosodic
<BR>or phonemic,
<BR>this raised eyebrow
<BR>like a circumflex over
<BR>the I of this poem?
<BR>So far it only
<BR>questions itself.
<BR>It shows a certain
<BR>manual dexterity,
<BR>but who can understand it?
<BR>Its face and its hands,
<BR>its tilting head,
<BR>its eye gaze--
<BR>beautiful--
<BR>its movement
<BR>and its invention--
<BR>the whole of its body shows
<BR>that it has passion...
<BR>But how will it persuade
<BR>with no voice?

<P>I went Deaf over 25 years..

<P>I was studying Medicine at the end..

<P>I almost dropped a baby on the floor of the Obstetrics ward.
<BR>all the masks were on and I was OUT!

<P>That was a hard lesson for me..
<BR>and I gave up medicine..

<P>There were lots of hard lessons for me..

<P>We all have them..
<BR>No doubt..


<P>Since then,
<BR>I have learned a lot.

<P>I have learned to love gardening and plants..
<BR>They are silent like we, the Deaf, are..

<P>And they love life voraciously like we do..
<BR>They ask no questions..

<P>But they give and give of themselves voluptuously..

<P>Silently they give and give..

<P>CAN WE DO THAT??

<P>I feel I am like a tree..
<BR>Or a sturdy bush..

<P>Cut down to it's core..
<BR>Cut down to MY Core..
<BR>No joke here..
<BR>Remember..

<P>It's me I am writing about..

<P>I was cut down to my beginings..
<BR>Back to my roots I was pruned..

<P>But..
<BR>I survived..
<BR>And sprung up soundly..
<BR>Soundlessly..

<P>Now I am new shoots..
<BR>Looking for myself in the sun.
<BR>Silently..

<P>New shoots..
<BR>New leaves..
<BR>New life..
<BR>Springing from my new being..

<P>I enjoy my new being inmensely..
<BR>I enjoy myself and my silence..

<P>They out there.. The Hearing.. Perturb me with their questions..

<P>Perturb me with their mouth movements..

<P>I tell them that their mouth movements make me dizzy..

<P>But they do it anyway..

<P>What the heck!!

<P>But I tough it out..

<P>I see the strong trees living by the Hearing freeways..
<BR>Lots of noise going on out there..
<BR>But they keep green and silent..
<BR>Growing in the sun..

<P>I can do that too..
<BR>Easily.. 

<P>I turn my eyes to the sun..
<BR>I ignore their noise..

<P>I live and awake..

<P>Welcoming each day with the warm friendship of all the silent beings that
surround me.

<P>I give myself to the joy of life each day.

<P>Silence has opened my heart to tenderness.. 

<P>Silence has allowed my fingers to feel the soft gentleness of delicate
existence..

<P>Please Deaf People..
<BR>Let us count always our blessings.. 

<P>Please All People..
<BR>Let us count our blessings..

<P>And let us smile silently towards the sun..
<BR>Let us send love to those we care for..

<P>They care for us..

<P>Even though we can't understand what they say to us..
<BR>They still care..

<P>Trying in their way..

<P>Let us all grow joyfully to what we may reach..

<P>Let us treasure our individual  existences..
<BR>And bless our surrounding beings..

<P>We are all tender children of God..

<P>We are all before our maker..

<P>Silent in the sun..
<BR>All of us..
<BR>Amen

<P>My family knew that I was deaf
<BR>When I was only three, 
<BR>and since then fifteen years ago
<BR>Have never signed to me.
<BR>I know when I'm around the house,
<BR>I try and use my voice,
<BR>It makes them feel more comfortable;
<BR>For me, I have no choice.
<BR>I try, communicate their way --
<BR>Uncomfortable for me.
<BR>My parents  wouldn't learn to sign
<BR>Ashamed or apathy?
<BR>I never cared about the sounds of
<BR>radio and bands;
<BR>What hurts me is, I never heard
<BR>My parent's signing hands.

<P>I will lend to you for awhile,
<BR>a pup, God said,
<BR>For you to love him while he lives
<BR>and mourn for him when he's dead.
<BR>Maybe for twelve or fourteen years,
<BR>or maybe two or three
<BR>But will you, 'till I call him back,
<BR>take care of him for me.

<P>He'll bring his charms to gladden you
<BR>and (should his stay be brief)
<BR>you'll always have his memories
<BR>as solace for your grief.
<BR>I cannot promise he will stay,
<BR>since all from earth return
<BR>But there are lessons taught below
<BR>I want this pup to learn.

<P>I've looked the whole world over
<BR>in search of teachers true
<BR>And from the folk that crowd's life's land
<BR>I have chosen you.
<BR>Now will you give him all your love
<BR>Nor think the labour vain,
<BR>Nor hate me when I come to take my Pup back again.

<P>I fancied that I heard them say
<BR>"Dear Lord Thy Will be Done,"
<BR>For all the joys this Pup will bring,
<BR>the risk of grief we'll run.
<BR>We'll shelter him with tenderness
<BR>we'll love him while we may
<BR>And for the happiness we've known forever grateful stay
<BR>But should you call him back
<BR>much sooner than we've planned,
<BR>We'll brave the bitter grief that comes,
<BR>and try to understand.
<BR>If, by our love, we've managed,
<BR>your wishes to achieve
<BR>In memory of him we loved,
<BR>to help us while we grieve,
<BR>When our faithful bundle departs this world of strife,
<BR>We'll have yet another Pup and love him all his life.
