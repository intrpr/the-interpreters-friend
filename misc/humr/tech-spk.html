<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"> was in Chemistry lab once, waiting to interpret when I saw someone with a t-shirt that said, "Si hoc legere nimium eruditionis habes."  I took two years of Latin in high school and I could tell it said something like, "If you can read this you have ... education."  I asked the wearer what it said, which was, "If you can read this you have too much education."  I was so relieved that I don't have to stop learning!  Although I am apparently border line.
