<P>Nothing. When we realized you weren't <BR>here we sat with our hands folded on our desks <BR>in silence for two hours

<P><DIR>Everything. I gave an exam worth <BR>40 per cent of the grade for this term <BR>and assigned some reading due today <BR>on which I'm about to hand out a quiz <BR>worth 50 per cent</DIR>

<P>Nothing. None of the content of this course  <BR>has value or meaning <BR>take as many days off as you like: <BR>any activities we undertake as a class <BR>I assure you will not  matter either to you or me <BR>and are without purpose.

<P><DIR>Everything. A few minutes after we began last time <BR>a shaft of light descended and an angel <BR>or other heavenly being appeared <BR>and revealed to us what each worshipper must do <BR>to attain divine wisdom in this life <BR> and the hereafter <BR>This is the last time the class will meet <BR>before we disperse to bring this good news to all people on earth</DIR>

<P>Nothing. When you are not present <BR>how could something significant occur?

<P><DIR>Everything. Contained in this classroom <BR>is a microcosm of human existence <BR>assembled for you to query and examine and ponder <BR>This is not the only place such an opportunity has been gathered <P>but it was one place <P>And you weren't here</DIR>

<P>Text is useless.  I use it to kill roaches in my room.
<P>He teaches like Speedy Gonzalez on a caffeine high.
<P>Help!  I've fallen asleep and I can't wake up!
<P>Have you ever fallen asleep in class and awoke in another?  That's the way I felt all term.
<P>Problem sets are a decoy to lure you away from potential exam material.
<P>Recitation was great.  It was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing -- It's a great stress reliever.
<P>He is one of the best teachers I have had.  He is well-organized, presents good lectures, and creates interest in the subject.  I hope my comments don't hurt his chances of getting tenure.
<P>The absolute value of the TA was less than epsilon.
<P>Information was presented like a ruptured fire hose -- spraying in all directions -- no way to stop it.
<P>The course was very thorough.  What wasn't covered in class was covered on the final exam.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"> was told that they were originally called Interpreter Training Programs until
some people complained that there programs weren't "training" interpreters (as
one would train a dog) but preparing students to become interpreters. Of course, one could complain that the programs aren't "preparing" interpreters (as one would prepare a meal) but training them in the necessary skills to become an interpreter. Or you could opt for Interpreter Education Programs - or maybe not (too much confusion with IEPs for Deaf students). Or maybe. . .

<P>Yes nurse, I'll take my medication now.

<P>When I was quite young, my father had one of the first
telephones in our  neighborhood.  I remember well the
polished  old case fastened to the wall.   The shiny receiver hung
on the  side of the box.  I was too little to reach   the telephone,
but used to listen with fascination when my mother used to talk to
it.

<P>Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device
lived an amazing person - her name was "Information Please"
and  there was nothing she did not know.  "Information Please"
could  supply anybody's number and the correct time.
 
<P>My first personal experience with this genie-in-the-bottle
came  one day   while my mother was visiting a neighbor.  Amusing
myself  at the tool bench in the basement, I whacked my finger
with a hammer.
 
<P>The pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason
in  crying  because there was no one home to give sympathy.  I
walked around  the house sucking my throbbing finger, finally arriving at the  stairway.
 
<P>The telephone!
 
<P>Quickly, I ran for the footstool in the parlor and dragged it
to  the  landing. Climbing up, I unhooked the receiver in the
parlor
and held it to my ear.  "Information Please," I said into the
mouthpiece just above my head.

<P>A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear.
"Information."

<P>"I hurt my finger. . ." I wailed into the phone.  The tears
came  readily enough now that I had an audience.

<P>"Isn't your mother home?" came the question.

<P>"Nobody's home but me." I blubbered.

<P>"Are you bleeding?"

<P>"No," I replied.  "I hit my finger with the hammer and it
hurts."

<P>"Can you open your icebox?" she asked.  I said I could.

<P>"Then chip off a little piece of ice and hold it to your
finger," said the voice.

<P>After that, I called "Information Please" for everything.  I
asked her for help   with my geography and she told me where
Philadelphia was.  She helped me with my math.  She told me
my pet chipmunk that I had caught in the park just the day
before would eat fruits and nuts.

<P>Then, there was the time Petey, our pet canary died.  I
called  "Information Please" and told her the sad story.  She
listened,  then said the usual things grown-ups say to soothe a
child.  But I was un-consoled.   I asked her, "Why is it that birds
should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families,
only  to end up as a heap of feathers on the bottom of a cage?"

<P>She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly,
"Paul,  always remember that there are other worlds to sing in."
Somehow I felt better.

<P>Another day I was on the telephone.  "Information Please."

<P>"Information," said the now familiar voice.

<P>"How do you spell fix?" I asked.

<P>All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest.

<P>When I   was 9 years old, we moved across the country to
Boston.

<P>I missed my friend very much.  "Information Please" belonged
in that old wooden box back home, and I somehow never thought
of trying the tall, shiny new phone that sat on the table in the
hall.

<P>As I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood
conversations never really left me.  Often, in moments of
doubt  and perplexity I would recall the serene sense of security
I had  then.  I appreciated now how patient, understanding, and kind
she was to have spent her time on a little boy.
 
<P>A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put
down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes.  I
spent 15  minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived
there now.  Then without thinking what I was doing, I dialed my hometown
operator and said,  "Information , Please".
 
<P>Miraculously, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well,
"Information."  I hadn't planned this but I heard myself
saying,  "Could you please tell me how to spell fix?"
 
<P>There was a long pause.  Then came the soft spoken answer, "I
guess your finger must have healed by now."
 
<P>I laughed.  "So it's really still you,' I said.  "I wonder if
you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time."
 
<P>"I wonder", she said, "if you know how much your calls meant
to me."  "I never had any children, and I used to look forward
to your calls."
 
<P>I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and
I asked if I could call her again when I came back to visit my
sister.
 
<P> "Please do, she said. "Just ask for Sally."
 
<P>Three months later I was back in Seattle.   A different voice
answered "Information."  I asked for Sally.
 
<P>"Are you a friend?"  She said.
 
<P>"Yes, a very old friend," I answered.
 
<P>"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, she said.  Sally had
been working part-time the last few years because she was sick.
She died five weeks ago."
 
<P>Before I could hang up she said, "Wait a minute.  Did you say
your name was Paul?"
 
<P>"Yes."
 
<P>"Well, Sally left a message for you.  She wrote it down in
case you called.  Let me read it to you."   The note said, "Tell
him I still say there are other  worlds to sing in.  He'll know
what I mean."
 
<P>I thanked her and hung up.  I knew what Sally meant.

<P>Truly, the life style of a school teacher has changed radically in
the last fifty or sixty years.  For example, a 1915 teachers'
magazine listed the following rules of conduct for teachers of that
day:

 <P>1.  You will not marry during the term of your contract.

 <P>2.  You are not to keep company with men.

<P>3.  You must be home between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. unless
     attending a school function.

<P> 4.  You may not loiter downtown in ice cream stores.

<P> 5.  You may not travel beyond the city limits unless you have the
     permission of the chairman of the board.

<P> 6.  You may not ride in a carriage or automobile with any man unless
     he is your father or brother.

<P>7.  You may not smoke cigarettes.

 <P>8.  You may not dress in bright colors.

<P> 9.  You may under no circumstances dye your hair.

<P>10.  You must wear at least two petticoats.

<P>11.  Your dresses must not be any shorter than two inches above the
     ankle.

<P>12.  To keep the school room neat and clean, you must: sweep the
     floor at least once daily; scrub the floor at least once a week
     with hot, soapy water; clean the blackboards at least once a
     day; and start the fire at 7 a.m. so the room will be warm by 8
     a.m.

<P><P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/t.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter T" HEIGHT="75">hen Jesus took his disciples up on the mountain and gathered them
around him.  And he taught them, saying,
<BR>"Blessed are the poor in spirit.
<BR>Blessed are the meek.
<BR>Blessed are the merciful.
<BR>Blessed are you who thirst for justice.
<BR>Blessed are you who are persecuted.
<BR>Blessed are you who suffer.
<BR>When these things begin to happen, rejoice, for your reward will be great in Heaven."

<P>And Simon Peter said, "Do we have to write this down?"
<BR>And Phillip said, "Will this be on the test?"
<BR>And John said, "Would you repeat that?"
<BR>And Andrew said, "John the Baptist's disciples don't have to learn this stuff."
<BR>And Matthew said, "Huh?"
<BR>And Judas said, "What's this got to do with real life?"

<P>Then one of the Pharisees, an expert in the law, said, "I don't see
any of this in your syllabus.  Do you have a lesson plan?  Is there a summary?
Where's the student guide?  Will there be a follow-up assignment?"

<P>Thomas, who had missed the sermon, came to Jesus privately and said,
"Did we do anything important today?"
