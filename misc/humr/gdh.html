<P>This satiric cartoon represents the artist's Deaf perspective on sign-language interpreters. Two interpreters are portrayed as cowboys or ranchers overseeing a herd of deaf cows and bulls. The terps see them as numbers and count them to imagine how much they can "rope in" in a day. Most interpreters get paid $25 an hour, which can add up to $200 daily. Many skilled interpreters earn much more than equally skilled Deaf people do, including (and especially) ASL teachers.  Many Deaf people resent interpreters taking Deaf people for granted and not giving something back to the Deaf community.

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<P>This cartoon satirizes Cued Speech. A ringmaster drums up support for Cued Speech, championing it as a method of instruction in schools serving D/deaf children. Deaf clowns perform a brilliant horse act by going in opposite directions while using Cued Speech.
<P>Cued Speech is an artificial system of manual cues that "display" vowels. It's used as an aid to speechreading. The cues, which are made near the mouth, have no relation to signs or fingerspelling. Many Deaf people resent the use of CS in schools. They prefer that ASL be used and taught instead, along with written English.

<P>An old time jumps trainer employs the services of a younger jumps jockey for the first time on a horse that is having its first start over the fences. He assures the young rider that if he follows his instructions, he'll get a sling from the long odds displayed by the bookies on-course.
<P>"Jump him out, take him to the front and just bound along" said the old trainer. "A stride before each fence, shout 'JUMP' at the top of your voice, and he'll clear it still galloping." The younger jockey thinks the old bugger is one leg short of the quaddie, but assures him that he'll do as he asks.
<P>The jump out of the gates, and working to the front he approaches the first fence. Not yelling the command, he hits the fence so hard that the horse knuckles, dislodging him from the saddle. Staying aboard and putting it down to a mistake on the horse's behalf, when approaching the second jump, he still refuses to yell 'jump' at the next fence. Needless to say, the horse knocks the fence down, and somehow the rider manages to stay in the saddle.
<P>By the time he realises that there may have been some merit in the trainer's commands, he has lost considerable ground, and is now twenty lengths off the pace. From here, he starts to shout "jump" to the horse, and the horse makes up fifteen of the twenty lengths by the home turn. Approaching the last jump a length off the leader, the horse ends up losing by a nose in a photo.
<P>When returning to the scale, the jockey sees that the trainer is furious. "Didn't you yell jump like I told you?" he asks. "I did, your horse must be deaf" insisted the rider. "Deaf? Deaf? The horse is bloody blind you idiot!"

as deafphobia? It seriously affects some hearing people who are clueless
on how to deal with a deaf person? Some counterclerks would freeze in their tracks, not knowing what to do upon being informed of customer's deafness? Some workplace employees constantly point at something on the wall, hoping that the deaf employee would instantly understand what is being said. Some people would wave away the deaf person hoping he would simply just go away. And so on.  So, is deafness-induced panic attack the same as deafphobia?

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/t.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter T" HEIGHT="75">here was a man who was touring old Spain for vacation. He came to this antique store and decided to check it out. While looking around, he saw a violin with a cheap tag. He asked the shopkeeper about it and was told that it has an ability to make all living things sleep when it is played. The man looked at the shopkeeper thinking that it's not true considering the fact that it's cheap. He went ahead and purchased the violin. He headed outside and began playing. Suddenly, people around him begain to sleep. He thought this was odd so he stopped and went elsewhere. He played his violin again and more people began to fall asleep. He even noticed that dogs and cats were falling asleep too. He decided to try it one more time so he walked elsewhere and tried again. He still got the same results. This got him excited. 

<P>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a poster advertising a bullfighting competition. They were offering a huge cash award to anyone who could stop a bull during a bullfight. He decided to go for it... using his violin. Now, he's in the stadium... with his violin in hand. Suddenly, the bull started approaching him. He calmly began playing his violin. The bull kept running. He begin playing his violin faster. The bull kept approaching closer. He got a bit nervous and begain playing faster and faster as the bull approached closer. At the last minute, he was playing really fast... but that did not stop the bull and the bull attacked. He lost. He got upset about the violin so he dropped it and jumped on it out of anger. Moments later, the owner of the bull approached this man and said, "Sir, sorry about your violin! Umm... the bull is deaf."

They stayed at this hotel during their honeymoon. While in their room, they had hours of fun. Later during the evening, the husband realized that he had left something in the car so he decided to go to the car to get it. He left the room, headed downstairs, and then headed for his car. After getting what he left in the car, he headed back to his room. Suddenly, he realized that he didn't remember which room he lived in. After a few moments, he headed back outside to his car and did one thing that came to mind. He began honking his horn loudly for a few moments. Suddenly, all the lights on the hotel went on as people were waking up from the sound of the horn. However, one light did not go on. "Bingo!" the man thought, "That's my room!"

The townspeople are frantically running everywhere, trying to escape being crushed by the giant. Suddenly the giant sees a beautiful blonde girl running down one of the streets and scoops her up in his hand. He looks at the terrified girl in his hand and immediately falls in love with her. "You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life," the giant says. "I think we should MARRY". When he makes the sign for MARRY, the girl is crushed to death. The giant looks sadly at the dead girl in his hand and wistfully remarks "I guess oralism really is better."

After an hour or so, the fellow was still very drunk and incoherent, so, being a nice guy, the first man decided to take him home.

<P>Then the process had to be repeated in front of the drunk's house. At last the nice guy got the deaf man up to the door and rang the bell, which was prompytly answered by a pleasant-looking woman. "Oh thanks you so much for bring my son home!" she said. "But where's his wheelchair?"

There's been so much discussion of supposed "divisions" within the deaf community lately (oral vs. ASL, educated vs. grassroots etc.) that it's all gone into sheer absurdity. Filmmaker Wayne Betts, Jr., apparently agrees, and developed three knee-slappin'-funny videos illustrating excellent caricatures of pretty much all of these "divisions." As a friend said, they're "genius-funny." Need a good, hard laugh? (1) Deaf Power, (2) Funny Joke, (3) Me Is The Good.

<P>A young guy out on the town with his mates spies the girl of his dreams across the dance floor. Having admired her from a far he finally gets up the courage to talk to her. Everything goes better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date the following Saturday evening.

<P>Saturday night the man arrives at her house with flowers and candy. To his
surprise, she answers the door in nothing but a towel. "I'm sorry," she
exclaims, "I am running a bit late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my
parents who will entertain you while I finish getting dressed. I should warn
you, though, they are both deaf mutes."

<P>With this she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and promptly disappears. As you can imagine, this is a little uncomfortable, as both of the parents are completely silent. Dad is sitting in his armchair watching cricket on TV, and Mum is busy knitting.

<P>After about ten minutes of complete silence, Mum jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her knickers, and pours a glass of water over her
backside. Just as suddenly, Dad launches himself across the room, bends her over the couch, and takes her from behind. He then sits back down in his chair and balances a match stick in front of his eye.

<P>The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. After a further ten minutes, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready for the evening.

<P>The date is a complete disaster with the young man completely distracted by the on goings earlier in the living room. At the end of the night, the girl asks, "What's the matter? Have I done something wrong?"

<P>"No, it's not you," he replied, "It's just that the strangest thing happened
while I was waiting for you and I am still a bit shocked. Well, first your
Mother jumps from her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties, and
throws a glass of water over her behind. Then, as if that weren't enough, your
Father races from his chair, leans her over the couch and does her from behind.
He then sits back down and places a match-stick by his eye."

<P>"Oh, is that all?" replies the girl. The man can't believe her casual response.

<P>"Mum was simply saying, 'Are you going to get this asshole a drink?' and Dad was replying, 'No, f**k him - I'm watching the match.'"

<P>[<IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/w.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter W" HEIGHT="75">ebmaster's note - During a discussion of babies and sign language, the following exchange took place between James Womack and Jeff Pollock:]
 
<P>...(my daughter used) one finger to denote 'water' instead of three fingers.
<BR>- James 


<P>My baby girl started off signing what looks like 'bitch' for water!  ;-)  
She's now 1.5 y/o and uses the right handshape for water.
<BR>- Jeff 

<P>So for a while, you were your daughter's bitch? :-D  Ah, sometimes I think all we dads are, the way our little princesses whittle money, some dress to die for, and other stuff from us.
<BR>- James 

<P>Well, my wife and I did joke about it and say stuff like "KAYLAH BITCHIN
AGAIN" to mean she's thirsty, or "WHERE BITCH?" to mean where's her bottle?,
etc.  Remember those "Where's the beef?" commercials from Wendy's?  :-)

<P>About a month ago, I was leading worship at the Winnipeg Church of the Deaf, an interfaith congregation receiving support from the Anglican and United Churches. The readings had to do with life after death. As always, there was a dialogue after the sermon for people to ask questions and discuss concerns. One fellow, Paul, asked me a question. "You talked about afterlife; do you believe in life before you were born?" 
<P>"You've asked a sensitive question for me," I responded, "All the time I grew up in the church, we talked about God being a part of me. It is called soul or spirit. When I die, my spirit will return to God. But I've started wondering, if God is forever, and part of me is God, and my soul will be with God for eternity when I die, then where was my soul before I was born? Did eternity start in 1948?" 
<P>"Have you tried to learn about your other lives?" Paul went on. 
<P>"No. It scares me, so I don't want to. What happens if I find out I am someone I don't like?" 
<P>There was lots of laughter, then Paul said he was curious. "But what if you discovered you were Alexander Graham Bell?" Bell is not a hero in Deaf Culture. He lead the movement to stop sign language and to force deaf people to speak. Much of Deaf Culture was lost because of him. Paul and the others looked shocked and responded with appropriate jesters of horror and humour. And then Paul, an activist in the deaf community, said, "But then that would explain why I am an activist. I want to change what I did."

After an hour or so, the fellow was still very drunk and incoherent, so, being a nice guy, the first man decided to take him home. He looked up the drunk's address in his wallet, then started struggling to get the man out to his car.  Dragging, heaving, and finally carrying the deaf man, he finally reached his car. 
<P>Then the process had to be repeated in front of the drunk's house.  At last the nice guy got the deaf man up to the door and rang the bell, which was prompytly answered by a pleasant-looking woman.  "Oh thanks you so much for bring my son home!" she said. "But where's his wheelchair?"

<P>Three hunters, Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, and a Deaf Cowboy, are 
gathered around a campfire. The 3 have been drinking and bragging 
about the virtues of their home states.
<P>Suddenly, Clint Eastwood says, "Watch this." He opens a bottle of 
tequila, takes a swig, tosses it in the air, pulls out a pearl-handled 
revolver and shoots the bottle cleanly in two.
<P>"It's a shame to waste that good liquor," John Wayne says.
<P>"It's OK," Clint replies, "Where I come from, we've got plenty of that" 
<P>Not to be outdone, John Wayne pulls out a bottle of Jack Daniel's. He 
pulls off the cork, takes a drink, throws the bottle in the air, whips 
out an assault rifle and blasts the bottle, sending shards of glass 
everywhere.
<P>"Shame to waste good whiskey," Clint says.
<P>"It's OK," John says, "We've got plenty in my state."
<P>At this point, the Deaf cowboy stands up. He pulls out a bottle of 
Henry's, twists off the cap and guzzels the entire beer. He throws the 
bottle high in the air, pulls out a shotgun, empties both barrels into 
John Wayne, and neatly catches the bottle.
<P>Clint stands in SHOCK. The Deaf cowboy calmly puts the shotgun down. 
"It's OK," he signed "We've got plenty of hearing people in my state, besides 
this bottle is worth a NICKEL."

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/a.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter A" HEIGHT="75"> deaf couple were discussing at noon what to eat for dinner. The wife
tells her hubby to go to the seafood market to buy 50 pds of escargots (live
snails). The hubby then walks to the market, enters, buys the escargots and
then leaves the market. As he walks back home, he sees a bar and decides to
go there because he is thirsty for a beer and that he had plenty of time left
before suppertime. Once when he is in the bar, he sits down at the bar
counter and orders a beer so that he could observe people. Then, a few guys
approaches the deaf man and gestures with him, buys a big pitcher of beer
for them to share and they continue to gesture with the deaf man. As the
hours pass by, they are still gesturing and that first pitcher of beer grows
into a couple of pitchers. The deaf man then looks at his watch, and it says,
5 p.m. and realizes that he is late for suppertime. He takes the bag full of
escargots with him from under the stool and then runs out of the bar. 
<P>As he runs,
he bumps into a deaf chum whom he has not seen for a long time. The deaf chum
invites him to go to the bar with him, but he says no, I have to go because
its suppertime and my wife is waiting for me! But the deaf chum says to the
deaf man, your wife is such a control freak and a nag! Besides, we haven't
seen each other for a long time, so will you please come over to have some
beers with me at the bar for a while? The deaf man gives in and goes over to
the bar with his chum and they chat and drink some beers.But they have
chatted and drank until the bar closed so the deaf man says good bye to his
friend and heads for home. 
<P>He arrives home and sees that the lights are off
in his house, meaning his wife is asleep. The deaf man then remembers that he
forgot his house key, so he has to ring the bell. The lights turn on and then
knowing that his wife can be a bitch because she can smell his beer breath.
So he thinks, "What can I do?" Then a great idea pops up in his mind and he
spills the snails out of the bag until they fall on the porch and are moving
around. Then the wife opens the door and she looks pissed off, but the deaf
man pretends to push the snails, and then says, I am sorry it took me so
long, I've been pushing the snails all the way from the market. The wife then
says, "O.K., but try to make the snails hurry up into the kitchen!!!"

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/d.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter D" HEIGHT="75">eaf people across Canada and the United States held a convention and took a vote. It was unanimous -- the oppression had become unbearable. They hired a number of space ships and set out en masse to establish a new planet -- one that would be based on their cultural norms! After flying for several years, they landed on an uninhabited planet, which they named EYEth. The language of education, politics, and media was ASL. The laws established reflected the cultural norms of the new inhabitants: police, judges, and lawyers were Deaf. Homes and businesses were arranged to maximize visual access. Children were born and things seemed ideal. 
<P>Then to the dismay of all, a child was born who could hear! Specialists were brought in and tests conducted, but it seemed nothing could be done to eliminate this unexpected disability. The child was sent to special schools and was required to wear large ear muffs, which emitted "white noise" and a mouth piece to prevent inadvertent utterance of spoken words. Still, in the privacy of his home or when he thought no one was looking, the child spoke and reacted to sounds around him. One day, scientists from the EYEth space program contacted the parents with good news. 
<P>They had discovered a distant planet where there were others like their child. With mixed feelings, the parents sent their son to EARth.

It was reported that at that mountain if you got to the top that you could be healed! As they were driving they could see the mountain in view. The bus came to a stop. The first man, who was in a wheelchair, started for the top. He kept on pushing his way.  Finally, he arrived at the top, and he stood up, walked a few steps, threw his wheelchair over the edge, and ran down to the bus yelling he was healed!!! The next man heard what was happening and he got out of the bus. He took out his cane as he was blind and made his way to the top. When he arrived, he threw his cane over the edge, because he too was healed! Down he ran to the bus.  The driver saw what was happening and he decided to give it a try. He and his interpreter, as the driver was Deaf, made their way to the top. After a short while the driver came back down. The other men asked if he was healed.  The driver explained, "I don't need a healing. I'm very happy being Deaf, but I was getting really sick of my interpreter, and I threw <U>her</U> over the edge."

Their Sign is like clouds in the fresh blue sky: dynamic, without bias. The clouds appear and grow and disappear on the horizon and in the sky as they want to appear and as they are needed. We are old, you and I.  We are cultured, educated, perhaps too influenced by the Hearing. Our skin is wrinkled. Theirs, the young Deaf, is so fresh and young. New visions, new signs. We must cheer them on, and let them go. Sit back and watch maybe. But tell the Hearing to get away. I hate the Hearing for they try to control us. Out of their fear, they torture and imprison us. The Hearing fear the beauty and originality of our Sign. They label us so constantly, always Initializing us. Always wordifying us. I hate them. I hate their words and their names. We see things so clearly, and they always mix us up!! They are so controlling in their apathy towards the Deaf. They think they know all of the world, but really they just want to make it easier for them to understand our communication and write "important papers" about it and make money off of us and get more  power.    
<P>I believe we must go back to the children always, and use the signs that they create, and see through their eyes to help us see the world the way it really is for us the Deaf.  We have become too much Hearing!! We must struggle to always maintain our Deaf Integrity. It is Hard. But it is very beautiful because it is our own. They cannot take it from us.
