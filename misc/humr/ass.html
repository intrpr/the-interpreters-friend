<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/n.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter N" HEIGHT="75">ice business, this "national certification" idea. It seems all you 
have to do is have "American" or "National" in the name of the 
organization, and you're in business.

<P>It seems the time is ripe for YAT: Yet Another Test.

<P>I am pleased to announce that I, er, the Roundtable of the American 
National Congress for Interpreting at the Deaf (RANCID) am pleased to 
announce the Web Online Examination of Interpreting Skill in Manual 
languages and spoken English (WOE-IS:M/E). The exam will take place 
entirely on the World Wide Web, scored automatically, and printable 
certificates will be issued immediately upon completion of the test.

<P>The instrument is the soon-to-be-highly-regarded Stanford Test*, and 
will be managed from a secure server in RANCID's world-wide 
headquarters in Nariz de Mocos, NM. The security of the server is 
well-tested, since it is the same rock-steady e-business platform that 
provides you with some of your favorite pop-unders, mortgage spam, and 
the World-Famous "Asian Grandmas and Farm Animals" website. Unlike 
those other so-called "Certifications," we take Paypal, and there's a 
1-900 number you can call which will charge USD 50 to your phone bill 
(US and Canada only).

<P>For another USD 100 and documentation of life experience credits, we 
can also provide a Masters of Arts in Interpreting Sciences (MAIS). We 
are fully accredited under the California Association of College 
Accreditors (CACA).

<P>Annual dues are $25 a year with a digitally signed statement that you 
are interpreting according to the Golden Rule.

<P>*Not affiliated with Stanford University, the Stanford Family, or any 
small towns named "Stanford." It is merely the name of the test 
developer's pet rock. Caveat Emptor.

<P>It has been suggested that there be a special certification for K-12 interpreter called, Persons Authorized Under Proficiency in Educational Resources (PAUPER).  I, er, the Board of Directors will
take that under advisement. We are, after all, highly qualified, since
we have all been through the school system. Mostly.

<P>More information on WOE-IS:M/E. You do get a level assigned.

<CENTER><P>The RANCID Level System:
<P><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="1">
<TR>
<P><TD>I</TD><TD>Ova</TD><TD>Knows the Alphabet. Can say, "I just love Am-slam...it's so graceful!"</td></TR>
<TD>II</TD><TD>Larva</TD><TD>Knows the first few chapters in the ABC book.
They think it's cute to talk ASL They.</td></TR>
<TD>III</TD><TD>Pupa</TD><TD>Deaf people are aware that these folks are actually signing.</td></TR>

<TD>V</TD><TD>God</TD><TD>Can sign real fast. Is supremely confident.</td></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>Remember, no one but us actually knows what these levels mean. The key
words are "Nationally Certified." Make sure you put them front-and-center on your business cards.

<P>Remember: if it isn't RANCID, you're paying too much.
