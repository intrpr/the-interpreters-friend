<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/q.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter Q" HEIGHT="75">: Why do interpreters' farts smell?
<BR><B>A</B>: So that Deaf people can have access to them, too.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">n the subject of tipping interpreters, it depends for me. One time, I was interpreting a drag show and the Deaf people started tipping me.  I didn't have any pockets, so I lay the money on the table beside me (I couldn't hold it in my hands, now, could I?) and continued to interpret.
<P><DIR>- Jean A. Miller</DIR>
<P>(In response to above:) Ahem. If you get tipped like the dancers, you should store the money like the dancers. O:-)

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">ne local terp I know is much cherished here. Even I at times think she's a bit too "helpful" but I wouldn't trade her in. She's too effective in communicating tone and implied messages via sign or facials. I find this usual given where I work.
<P>But let me tell you one of the reasons she is held dear. It's not because she's a pushover, quite frankly, you wouldn't want to piss her off. But here's one of many examples of her HUMAN side. DP is a car accident. Hospital is loathe to provide a terp. She gets wind of it, offers services free (because she knows this city and how ignorant and ARROGANT it is, especially doctors when it comes to any disabled group). They often refuse to provide services the law says they should. Now, the DP is new in town at the time and from a rather distant location (an island). During this time, the doctors handled his injured legs and hands roughly, in fact, they acted like sadists, ignoring the DP's howls of obvious pain. They worked on him without pain killers or anesthetics when such were clearly called for. 
<P>Yes, some doctors here are that callous because they have gotten away with it, indeed a lot of people here ,hearing or Deaf go to California  for treatment rather than use local doctors so it's that bad. Back to our terp. She basically stood up to those doctors on his behalf, was there often at the hospital since his family was very distant and if I recall right, were not informed of his situation for some reason. In a nutshell, she stayed  and protected him from abuse there. To this day, he cherishes her and so do a lot of other Deaf, myself included. My point is, some terps have a following simply because they remember how to be human beings while others have become distant and aloft. Smart businesses know that to keep customers you have to have a person touch.
<P>Now list [TERPS-L], don't go foolish by implying I am saying you have to cater to every Deaf whim, surrender your life to servitude and other such hogwash. You know I am saying that in some cases terps with a following have it because they don't treat the Deaf like lepers, or have an attitude of "Here's your spoon, now pay me and get out of my way as I head for the door." I'm all for professionalism but some behaviors I have seen border on resentment and make us Deaf wonder why the person is a terp.

<P>"It is given to me"
<BR>is the passive they're parsing
<BR>in linguistics class.

<P>I'm interpreting for
<BR>a deaf girl making
<BR>eyes at me

<P>and noise with her corn chips'
<BR>plastic wrapper.
<BR>She's tongueing a corn chip

<P>and wrinkling her nose
<BR>which she knows I know
<BR>means ooh salty,

<P>and telling me in
<BR>no uncertain terms
<BR>it is given to me.

<P>Sometimes it happens
<BR>that way, love
<BR>just lands in your lap,

<P>starts conjugating itself
<BR>in the second person
<BR>singular.

<P>So I ask her to marry me,
<BR>to give up linguistics,
<BR>come live with me in

<P>my house in the suburbs
<BR>among the Thickly Settled signs.
<BR>Here's the church

<P>and here's the steeple.
<BR>The deaf people sit
<BR>where they can see the interpreter.

<P>We'll name our first child
<BR>Vowel, after
<BR>the dilating mouth

<P>of pleasure,
<BR>we'll fill our home
<BR>with the tongues of a hundred

<P>speechless lives:
<BR>the plosives of fish
<BR>browsing the fishbowl,

<P>the shrugging shoulders
<BR>of the spider plants,
<BR>the noiseless stutter

<P>of candles.

<P><IMG SRC="../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10">Melby, A. K.  (1995).  <A HREF="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/reception/19/akmelby.htm">Why can't a computer translate more like a person?</A> Webmaster: I have included this same web site under "Interpreter error" because it talks about machine and human errors.  The reason that it is here also is that I believe if you read it you will acquire greater respect for translators (and similarly for interpreters) who get it right most of the time. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/a.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter A" HEIGHT="75"><B> letter of thanks [from a mentored interpreting student]</B>
<P>I would like to take this time to thank all the interpreters for sharing their gifts with me.  I have come to the understanding that interpreters are like musicians.  You must practice everyday.  You must possess the desire to keep improving your talents.  You expose your soul in every performance.  Your audience is forever changing, and can be critical of even your best work.  Much like a musician who interprets a score, it's not just the notes, words, or signs themselves, but how you render them.  Some interpreters produce symphonies, and other, soft rock.  Regardless of your particular style, like a musical note, your work exists for only a second in time, and then vanishes.  The interpreter is the musician who transforms words into life, as they change them from one mode to another.
<P>Thank you for allowing me to observe you.  You demonstrated how additions clarify, how repetitions emphasize, how omissions can reduce confusion, and what a gift lag time is.  Watching you work was a far more effective lesson than any classroom lecture.  Your attitude and demeanor speak volumes.  What wonderful role models you are!  You've exceeded my expectations with such grace!
<P>You offered yourselves as mentors.  I can't thank you enough for giving so much of yourselves to me.  You encouraged, corrected, guided and practiced with me, and you listened to me.  You encouraged me to fly, and when I crash landed, you picked me up, mended my ego, and encouraged me to fly again, suggesting a slightly modified flight plan.  You endured my blunt questions, my mediocre fluency, my lack of patience, and my frustrations.  You listened to me and showed me that you cared.
<P>It's been a privilege to know you.  Thank you for sharing your time and your talents with me,  i have grown, and I only hope that one day, I can become as gifted a musician as you are.  Thank you.

<P>Fingers flying in the open air
<BR>Coffee belching down below
<BR>folks rush to work with a desperate flair
<BR>and don't have time for love to show

<P>Everybody knows that up thumb Paul's  a-working still
<BR>At keeping spam off of the list
<BR>James and Susan voice opinions at will 
<BR>And we all feel like we've been kissed

<P>We know that 2001 will bring a change
<BR>We know that life will change over time
<BR>And every teachers wish will have a range
<BR>In hopes the students finally learn to sign

<P>And so I'm offering some shinning rays
<BR>For terps from grads to CODAs too
<BR>Although it can be  signed many times many ways
<BR>Merry Christmas to you

<P>Although it can be signed many times  many ways
<BR>Merry Christmas to you

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/w.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter W" HEIGHT="75">hat then shall we say brothers?  When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a tongue or an interpretation.  All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.  If anyone speaks in a tongue, two -- or at most three -- should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.  If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.

<P>Q: Which son of a United States president knew sign language and liked to use it on a daily basis with the White House police?
<P>A: Archie Roosevelt, a pre-teenaged son of President Theodore Roosevelt, learned signs from one of the White House police officers and liked to use it daily.  He wanted to volunteer as an interpreter for the deaf White House visitors but the father nixed the idea!

<P>The moving lips speak voicelessly -- but hark:
<BR>The winging words fly from your fluttering hands;
<BR>And each, who dwells in silence, understands
<BR>How Dawn, the rosy-fingered, burns the dark
<BR>From shadow-worlds wherein the teeming brain
<BR>Lay, like a captive, in a dungeon-cell;
<BR>Your magic bursts the iron citadel,
<BR>And breaks the lock, and brings the light again!
<P>Dear friend, how empty, vain and commonplace
<BR>Must seem this gratitude we offer you;
<BR>Yet now we render homage, as your due,
<BR>Remembering your patience, love and grace --
<BR>With twining fingers as you blithely go,
<BR>Daily, to fell our Walls of Jericho.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75"><B>ur hope</B>
<P>Some of the dominant class join the oppressed in their struggle for liberation.  Theirs is a fundamental role and has been so throughout the history of this struggle.  However, as they move to the side of the exploited they always bring with them the marks of their origin.  Their prejudices include a lack of confidence in the people's ability to think, to want, and to know.  So they truly desire to transform the unjust order, they believe that they must be executors of the transformation.
<P>They talk about the people but thy do not trust them: and trusting the people is the indispensable precondition for revolutionary change.  A real humanist can be identified more by his trust in the people, which engages him in their struggle, than by a thousand actions in their favor, without their trust.

<CENTER><P>Although you're not deaf,
<BR>our doorway to the silent world
<BR>is always open.
<P>Your communication flows
<BR>in either sound or silence
<BR>which can open the eyes and ears
<BR>of those who can and cannot hear.
<P>Your understanding of both sides of the coin
<BR>is a gift of a special kind of culture
<BR>which can never be taken away.
<PL>Always walk with your head high
<BR>knowing that you have
<BR>the greatest gift of all. . .
<P>The Best of Both Worlds. . . Yours and Mine.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"><B>nterpreters influence languages</B>

<P>In the sixteenth century, Austria's ambassador visited Turkey and became enchanted with the unusual flowers there. The Turks' traditional name for this flower was "lale", but because of its shape,  the Austrian's interpreter jokingly called the blossom a "tulbend",  which is the Turkish word for "turban." The ambassador delightedly  brought home several of these exotic plants and its picturesque nickname as well, which eventually wound up in English as "tulip."

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"><B>nterpreters are human</B>

<P>Interpreters are human, believe it or not, much like the rest of us.
<BR>They come in both sexes and in various sizes,
<BR>but they are usually ladies, who are always most attractive.

<P>Interpreters are found everywhere:
        <DIR>in court
                <DIR>in the doctor's office
                       <DIR>in churches
        </DIR></DIR>in homes
                <DIR>at weddings
                       <DIR>and at funerals.
</DIR></DIR></DIR>They are usually around where there are deaf people,
<BR>often relating all sides of a three-way conversation.

<P>Interpreters must have
        <DIR>the wisdom of Solomon
                <DIR>the disposition of a  l a m b
        </DIR>the endurance of ste-e-e-el
                <DIR>and the grace of a kitten.
</DIR></DIR>They interpret for a deaf mother whose son is being
<BR>questioned at Juvenile Hall, or honored at school.
<BR>Too often they must interpret for a deaf child whose
<BR>parents have made no effort to learn to communicate
<BR>with him in sign language.

<P>An interpreter who does well "has such beautiful
<BR>motions."  When he gets confused and flustered
<BR>he "disrupts the whole meeting."

<P>At church he interprets the invocation . . .
        <DIR>the call to worship . . .
                <DIR>the congregational songs . . .
                        <DIR>the announcements . . .
        </DIR></DIR>the anthem . . .
                <DIR>the sermon . . .
                        <DIR>and the benediction.
</DIR></DIR></DIR>Then that evening the pastor is away so the interpreter
<BR>is faced with a substitute who mumbles, st-st-stutters,
<BR>has an Irish brogue and who didn't have time to
<BR>prepare so he "j-u-s-t  t-a-l-k-s."

<P>Interpreters are asked questions:
        <DIR>"Do you read lips?"
                <DIR>"Can you read Braille."
        </DIR>"Why don't all deaf people use a hearing aid?"
</DIR>And then, most people assume interpreters are making
<BR>some kind of manual short hand or semaphore with their
<BR>hands instead of using a distinct language with all the
<BR>nuances and difficulties faced by the expert
<BR>translators at the United Nations building.

<P>Interpreters are at work in any kind of weather --
        <DIR>any time of day --
                <DIR>any season of the year --
</DIR></DIR>listening to excuses why others couldn't come:
        <DIR>"it rained,"
                <DIR>"the hour was too late" and
                        <DIR>"its Christmas time."

</DIR></DIR></DIR><P>An interpreter who stands up in the front of the
<BR>audience seeks attention.  If he sits down to interpret
<BR>he doesn't put himself into his work.  If he speaks out
<BR>during the meeting he is out of his professional role.
<BR>If he keeps silent he is not supportive.   If he has been
<BR>interpreting for only a few years he lacks experience.
<BR>If he has been interpreting for many years he is in a rut
<BR>and old fashioned.  If he uses a lot of facial expression
<BR>he distracts from the speaker.  If he doesn't he is a
<BR>dead-pan puppet.   If he doesn't train others to help him
<BR>he thinks no one is as good as he is.  If he does train
<BR>others he is trying to pass himself off as an expert.

<P>Interpreters like:
        <DIR>co-op-er-a-tion. . .
        <BR>!!!appreciation!!! . . .
        <BR>and to see deaf people become self sufficient.</DIR>
<BR>They dislike: to be conspicuous, to be imposed upon and to face the
<BR>ignorance of those who know nothing about deafness, or see the
<BR>interpreter as just a "machine."

<P>Interpreters are human --
        <DIR>usually very busy humans
               <DIR>occasionally very tired humans
        </DIR>seldom very unhappy humans.
