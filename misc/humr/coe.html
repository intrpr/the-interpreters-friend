<LI>At the start of all meetings, workshops, or conferences, always start the ball rolling by telling a funny joke or story.
<LI>If the deaf person takes a long time to answer a question, or seems unsure of what to say, <U>don't let them flounder</U> -- help the deaf people out by providing any information you may have related to the topic.  If you are unfamiliar with the topic, <U>make up an answer</U>.  Remember, awkward and halting conversation can't lead to successful communication.
<LI>Always offer (or interject) your personal opinion.
<LI>Make sure that you're always the center of attention.  If the audience is focusing on the hearing speaker, stand up, dance around, or make wierd facial expressions.
<LI>Always wear the current fashion styles (bright colors and checkerboard prints are best.)
<LI>Before, after, and during breaks give brief lectures on deafness, how you became involved in interpreting, and highlights of your childhood.
<LI>If you become drowsy during an interpreting assignment, take a nap for 15-20 minutes.</OL>

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/w.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter W" HEIGHT="75">hen I was going through Jedi interrogation school at Ft. Huachuca, there was a unit we had on working with interpreters. It went over the basics: job description, consecutive vs. simultaneous, prepping with an interpreter, qualifications, etc. We also saw a film documenting the use of native interpreters in Vietnam, many of whom were VC sympathizers. So you'd have an exchange like this:

<P><B>Lieutenant:</B> "Tell them I'd like ask a few questions."
<BR><B>Interpreter:</B> "This ignorant capitalist swine wants you to betray us."
<BR><B>Villager:</B> "Tell him to get lost."
<BR><B>Interpreter:</B> "I'd be happy to help. Go ahead."
<BR><B>Lieutenant:</B> "Have any VC guerrillas been in the village recently?"
<BR><B>Interpreter:</B> "Count to ten! Loudly!"
<BR><B>Villager:</B> "One!  two.... three!..." (etc)
<BR><B>Interpreter:</B> "It was terrible. They came through the village and stole our children..." (etc.)

<P>You get the idea. How many people on both sides lost their lives
because of crap like this?

<P>I used to interpret a shop class. Students worked pretty independently, would seek out the instructor when they had a question. For a long time I interpreted their attention-getting hand-waves as "Excuse me, Mr. Jackson." (Not his real
name, of course.) Often had trouble getting teacher's attention. One day I happened to interpret a big hand-wave as, "YO JACKSON!" When the teacher immediately responded and answered the student's question, I realized that I had finally interpreted appropriately! Polite little excuse-me's were not what the student had been signing, nor were they appropriate to communicatioin between males in this dirt-under-fingernails environment. 

<P>My immediate internal reaction after I yelled "YO!" was to feel I had 
done something wrong. Where did that feeling come from? It wasn't that the behavior was out of line - the teacher and most of the students talked like that all the time. It wasn't that as a female, I was unable or unwilling to behave in masculine ways; I was accustomed to mostly male environments, having worked in the trades  for a while. I eventually figured out that I had internalized a bunch of attitudes about being a "professional", including some middle class assumptions  about politeness.

<P>You'd think I'd have known better. Sheesh, the more ya learn, the more ya
learn ya gotta learn.

<P>Part of my job as a public-health nurse is teaching new parents how to care for their infants.  As I was demonstrating how to wrap a newborn, a young Asian couple turned to me and said, "You mean we should wrap the baby like an egg roll?"  Yes, I replied, that was a good analogy.
<P>"I don't know how to make egg rolls," another mother said anxiously.  "Can I wrap my baby like a burrito?"

<P>While I was touring with an international repertory theater, we performed in a small village church in Scotland.  Our program to a packed house began with several short, humorous plays.  No one laughed at the first one, or at the second.  By the end of the third play, the leader of our troupe said, "They must hate us.  They're not even smiling.  We'll cut the program short."
<P>At a reception following the performance, we were puzzled when everyone said how much they had enjoyed us.  I finally overhead one kilt-clad gentleman say to his friends, "Och, they wir so funny it was all I could do not to laugh in the chirch."

<P>Interpreting a la Stanislavski,eh? How do we do this thing. . . this Becoming? And while we "are" this person, where "are" we? I wonder how much we kid ourselves into thinking that we take on someone's persona.

<P>Okay, it's a lot more complicated than that. But we're not Counselor Troi.
Sometimes I've gotten carried away in the moment and "connected" somehow, but
this is a far cry from subsuming my own identity. In fact, Seleskovitch,
chapter 3, verse xxix reads: "And lo, thou shalt feel free to agree or
disagree with the speaker; for in doing so, thou shalt come to a more
excellent understanding of The Message, which Thing thou shalt interpret."
Here endeth the lesson. No "method interpreting." No mystical union. No
parapsychology.

As I voice interpreted a student's comments, I noticed that my teammate was moving her hands.  I was taken aback when I realized that she was signing what I was voicing.  I asked her during a break why she was doing this.  "So that the consumers can check the quality of the interpretation."  I asked her, "So you want me to voice what you sign as an interpretation so that the hearing people can check your quality when you are up?"  She stopped her echo interpretation.  The event still puzzles me.

<P>"There was this law student standing in line somewhere waiting when all of a sudden he felt these hands on his shoulders massaging him.  He turned and said, 'Huh?! What's going on?'  The massager (masseur?) said, 'Oh, I'm learning how to massage, so I was just practicing on you.'  The will-be lawyer responded, 'So?  I'm going to be a lawyer, but you don't see me screwing the guy in front of me!'"
<P>So, what would you all do out there in Interpreterland?  The interpreter was embarrassed, but I told her that there was no way that she could have interpreted that.  Impossible.

His vocabulary was scathing and very high-falutin' but he had almost no facial expression, since the key to his message was in his inflated vocabulary and his very resonant and agile voice.  I had a great time tell the class how absolutely incompetent they were. After a few minutes of the Deaf student watching me scold them with great vehemence and then looking at the instructor's stone face, he shook his head at me as if to say, "You've got to be making this up!"

Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf person for this job; if he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.

<P>Well, on his first week, the deaf collector picks up over $40,000. He
gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place.
The mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of
their hoods after the deaf collector.

<P>The hoods find the deaf collector and ask him where the money is. The
deaf collector can't communicate with them, so the mafia drags the guy
to an interpreter.

<P>The mafia hood says to the interpreter, "Ask him where da money is." The
interpreter signs,"Where's the money?"

<P>The deaf replies, "I don't know what you're talking about." 

<P>The interpreter tells the hood,"He says he doesn't know what you're
talking about"

<P>The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the deaf collector.
"NOW ask him where the money is."

<P>The interpreter signs, "Where is the money?" 

<P>The deaf replies, "The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park." 

<P>The interpreter's eyes light up and says to the hood, "He says he still
doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the
balls to pull the trigger."

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/w.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter W" HEIGHT="75"><B>hat would you do?</B>

<P>KIEV, Ukraine, Nov. 28 - The most striking, and the most
potentially significant, public rebellion against President
Leonid D. Kuchma and his chosen successor in last Sunday's
contested election began silently. 

<P>Last Thursday morning, Natalia Dimitruk, an interpreter for
the deaf on the Ukraine's official state UT-1 television,
disregarded the anchor's report on Prime Minister Viktor F.
Yanukovich's "victory" and, in her small inset on the
screen, began to sign something else altogether. 

<P>"The results announced by the Central Electoral Commission
are rigged," she said in the sign language used in the
former Soviet states. "Do not believe them." 

<P>She went on to declare that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the
opposition leader, was the country's new president. "I am
very disappointed by the fact that I had to interpret
lies," she went on. "I will not do it any more. I do not
know if you will see me again." 

<P>Ms. Dimitruk's act of defiance, which she described in an
interview on Sunday as an agonized one, became part of a
growing revolt by a source of Mr. Kuchma's political power
as important as any other: state television. 

<P>In Ukraine, as in Russia and other parts of the former
Soviet Union, state ownership or control over the media,
especially television, exerts immense control over
political debate, shoring up public attitudes not only
about the state, but also about the opposition. The state's
manipulation of coverage was among the reasons that
observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe called the Nov. 21 vote fundamentally
unfair. 

<P>Ms. Dimitruk, for her part, said her rebellion violated her
own ethics as an interpreter. Only UT-1 provides
simultaneous interpretation for Ukraine's deaf. (The
Ukrainian Society of the Deaf includes 60,000 members,
though the number of deaf overall is probably higher.) For
them, she said, she is a rare and trusted source of
information. As the protests unfolded, though, she felt
compelled to present her opinion of what was happening. 

<P>"The deaf, they do not have a choice of what they watch,"
she said.

open containers.  When a policeman came over to ask them their ages, the
interpreter signed the question but his sign for YOU was made with the thumb
moving up and down, changing it to the sign for 21.  They all took the hint and said they were 21.  You can debate how this fits into the CoE or not as
wish.

There was one short moment in the play where there was some nudity, but before I knew it would be toned down, they told me I would have to interpret the play in my birthday suit.  I told them that if I did there would not be proper contrast and besides that the audience might realize by my body's reaction that I was not entirely neutral.

S/he would doze half-way through the lecture regularly.  I never could understand this because my interpreting was pretty fascinating to me :-) and since I'm the center of my little universe, my consumer's world must have been revolving around me.  Ergo, *I* must be the cause of their every action.
<P>This is quite a responsibility.  I had a few choices:
<P>1 - Use all the guilt at my disposal to hone my skills to a Louie Fantish monofilament, and lash myself with shame every time my client looked even remotely bored.  I'd be brilliant, but miserable.
<P>2 - Chew the consumer out for daring to fall asleep during the very zenith of my interpreting career.  I'd feel really good about myself but I'd be out of work.
<P>3 - Pull my head out of my ego long enough to accept responsibility for *my* actions, and not for everything the consumer may or may not have gotten.  I'd been imperfect, but it'd be a good clean, *human* Imperfect.

<P> Thousands of concertgoers fastened their safety belts
 and geared up for the roller coaster of their lives. On
 the evening of Tuesday, October 27, [1998,] Marilyn
 Manson made his second appearance at the Fox
 Theatre in St. Louis. 

<P> A sea of bodies dressed mostly in black and
 handfuls of painted goth faces filled the seats of the
 prestigious concert hall as the anticipation grew
 unbearable. Outside, religious groups demonstrated
 by carrying signs boycotting Marilyn Manson's
 scheduled performance. 

<P> Shortly after 7:30 p.m., 12 Rounds, a British goth
 group newly signed to nothing Records, entered the
 stage to play a nine-song, 50-minute set. Fronted by
 Claudia Sarne, whose voice has been described as a
 cross between Cruella De Vil and Eartha Kitt, this
 gothic group slithered their way onto the crowd. A
 dark mood lingered which appeared to be too
 gloomy or too boring for most of the charged
 Marilyn Manson fans. The music was as mysterious
 as the vocals. One devoted Manson fan stated,
 "They need more metal. It's too calm in here. Other
 than that, I love her tights." At times, the sign
 language interpreter received more attention. 

<P> Smoke filled the area as Manson appeared before
 everyone's eyes in his sky blue bodysuit complete
 with a cape and thong to patch up those exposed
 areas. His hairspray-stiff, red-streaked black hair
 warped everyone back to the '80s. 

<P> The bright lights and costumes revealed a more
 glam-rock Hollywood style, more Marilyn than
 Manson. Costume changes occured as often as the
 number of times Manson spat into the crowd, which
 is to say very often. 

<P> The really controversial stuff began in the second
 half of the show. To start off, Manson taunted the
 security guards, one in particular, during "User
 Friendly," a song about how one uses another for
 their own gratification without being in love. 

<P> Soon after that, Manson paused to ask why there
 were sign language interpreters at his concert. "Are
 there any deaf people here? I didn't think you could
 f***ing hear me." He then incited the audience to
 spit on the interpreters.

One time, I was interpreting a drag show and the Deaf people started tipping me.

<P>Once, long ago and far away, a deaf student came into the class I was interpreting, looking like the cat drug him in.  He told me that he'd had a late night *studying* and that he'd slip me $5.00 if I would just keep on interpreting while he put on his shades and slept through class.
<P>What an ethical dilemma I faced!  I guess he didn't know that when our meter starts running as interpreter, it almost never stops.  I took the $5, kept on interpreting, and then the two of use went out after class for some serious caffeine - my treat, as I was suddenly flush with money.

<P>Hey, there are days when I resent having to work, too. :-) In fact,
sometimes it feels like the Holy Grail of interpreting would be having
my appointment book chock-full of no-show, flaky consumers and paying
clients who let you go within 10 minutes. It'd be like having my own
personal corporate welfare. The only thing that would better is if I
could do that from home (or a hotel on the beach) via video relay.
<P>I hate waiting around, but let's face it, there are times when my
clients have to wait for *me*. And for sure, there are times when
everybody has to wait for the doctor (no 15-minute rescheduling
deadline for the doc... ain't it funny how that works?). Take a book,
or a laptop, or something and get productive (or lazy!) while you wait.
If I can get paid for sitting around and doing my billing... well, it
almost makes me feel like a professional.
<P>And then there are the times on college campuses where there's a
10-minutes-per-class-hour cutoff time for no-shows, where you *think*
your client is not coming and mentally you've already spent the time...
when, whaddya know, they show up in the last 30 seconds. There isn't a
whole lot to do but say a mantra (my favorite is "$%@& -- son of a
!@$#^%@," etc. Hum along if you know the words), paste a smile on my
face, and do my job.
<P>And then there are the Post Office jobs, where you get dragged around
by some stopwatch-toting sadist who holds you for 1 hour, 59 minutes,
and 59 seconds. Of course, all they're doing is being smart consumers.
Again with the mantra. :-)

<P>(The following is a response to someone's complaints about an interpreter for Peter Yarrow.  Sorry I can't find the original posting.)

<P>I know the interpreter in question - I'll lay odds on it.  To me that is NOT
interpreting.  That is a frustrated WANNA-BE with a lot of chutzpah who has
convinced some well intentioned performers that that is what interpreting
music is all about.  Poor deaf people can't see music so she has to make it
visible and needs most of the stage to do it.   This is more than likely
the same interpreter who told a newspaper interviewer how she interprets
for the LA Philharmonic (no singers involved mind you just instruments)
she listens to the music and then conjures up and image and tells the people
what that image is. . . my favorite was was that some parts of Mozart
(Vivaldi?) reminded her of what a Chinese Man walking in a forest sounds
like!   So that's what she tells the deaf people in between her
interpretive dance moves.  PUH LEEZE.  This is not interpreting.  Nor do I
want to lend it any credence by calling it performance art.  Which is how
some folks refer to themselves: Artists not interpreters.  Then if that is
so , I would hope that the program would say " The person off to the side
of the stage doing all this hand flapping and gyrating  is a performance
artist who may on occasion use a sign that a deaf person might understand.
We thinks she looks neat and makes us look like we care.  Enjoy her xxx

<P>Recently, I have noticed many special interest groups (SIGs) popping up in different professions or clubs.  RID is no exception to this.  We have LeGIT, EdITOR, ITOC, etc.  It really doesn't matter if you agree or disagree with the concept of SIGs; the fact is they seem to be here to stay.  With this in mind, I started thinking that there must be many special circumstances out there in Interpreter World that might warrant a Special Interest Group.  I think we should start sharing these ideas with one another to see if there is enough interest out there to establish other SIGs.  I invite anyone with any ideas about a SIG that he or she feels would be important to drop me a note explaining his or her thoughts.
<P>To start off, I have a SIG that I would like to organize.  It would be called ITWFTGOWST.  So maybe it's not easy to pronounce,  I never was very clever with acronyms.  "What is ITWFTGOWST?" you ask.  "I will explain," he replied.  The following situation has plagued me more than once, and I suspect it may have happened to some of you as well.  You are standing in front of the room in a mainstream class, very professional-looking with your contrasting interpreter attire on.  The teacher is lecturing away, and your hands are doing all the right things.  Suddenly, a student does something that the teacher really objects to.  The teacher's voice rises, and you think to yourself "Oh , boy. . . stay true to the message. . . show the emotions on your face and in your hands and do all those correct interpreter things."  By now the teacher is really mad and bawling this kid out but good!  The other kids in the class have serious looks on their faces.  The Deaf student has that same look.  Finally, the teacher says "and if you forget your homework again tomorrow. . ."  Then it happens.  As you flash your signs in the angry fashion that the teacher is conveying, your thumb hooks under your glasses as you sign "tomorrow", and they flip across the room.  Needless to say, this breaks the mood that the teacher intended for the class, not to mention making you feel like the world's biggest jerk.  After the entire class (except the teacher) stops laughing and someone hands you back your glasses, there's not much else you can say.
<P>If this is a problem for other interpreters out there, let's start:

<P>Interpreters and 
<BR>Transliterators
<BR>Who 
<BR>Flip 
<BR>Their 
<BR>Glasses 
<BR>Off
<BR>While
<BR>Signing
<BR>TOMORROW

<P>If this group is successful, maybe we can start the ITTCTCWST (Interpreters and Transliterators That Cut Their Chins While Signing TRUE).

to live on the edge, with a higher degree of spontaneity.  In fact, I make it a point to show up about five minutes late to each appointment, that way all the players are really glad to see me when I finally arrive, huffing, puffing and sweating;  the Deaf person, the hearing person, my team...I find that the inevitable summarizing of the past five minutes information that occurs due to me bursting through the door unexpectedly and disrupting the meeting generally provides me with all the "prebriefing" content I need to know.

<P>I mean, what is there to talk about before an assignment? Establishing a
relationship, content, vocabulary, history? C'mon, those are all things that
can be discussed at the conclusion of the assignment over a beer or coffee.

<P>I used to interpret a shop class. Students worked pretty independently, would seek out the instructor when they had a question.  For a long time I interpreted their attention-getting hand-waves as "Excuse me, Mr. Jackson." (Not his real name, of course.) Often had trouble getting teacher's attention.  One day I happened to interpret a big hand-wave as, "YO! JACKSON!" When the teacher immediately responded and answered the student's question, I realized that I had finally interpreted appropriately!  Polite little excuse-me's were not appropriate to communication between males in this dirt-under-fingernails environment.
<P>My immediate internal reaction after I yelled "YO!" was to feel I had done something wrong.  Where did that feeling come from?  It wasn't that the behavior was out of line Ð the teacher and most of the students talked like that all the time.  It wasn't that as a female I was unable or unwilling to behave in masculine ways.  I eventually figured out that I had internalized a bunch of attitudes about being a "professional", including some prissy middle class overly polite stuff.  (Fortunately it wasn't too hard to rip THAT garbage out by the roots.)  
<P>You'd think that after all my years of lefty feminist activism I'd have known better.  Sheesh, the more ya learn, the more ya learn that ya gotta learn.

<P>My first contact with the world of translation was in Madrid in the early
1980s where I was living in a garret flat, my only source of income a
monthly wad of notes pressed into my hand by an unregistered staff member
of the Irish embassy at a prearranged venue.

<P>It was on a balmy evening in late spring that I first met Amaia who was
working the terraces in the Plaza Mayor. Of course I had seen the
"palabreras" before, shuffling from table to table offering cheap
translations, with one eye over their shoulders for the police, but I had
always avoided entering into conversation with such people. Amaia, however,
was different. Unlike the others, she held her head proudly, and her first
words were: "Any of these (she waved a dismissive hand in the direction of
the other translators on the beat) could do the job in half the time and
for half of my price, but if you believe that quality is worth paying for,
I'm the one you're looking for". I had been brought up a strict
monolinguist, and I was instinctively repulsed by her offer, but I invited
her to stay for a drink with me.

<P>After that, we began to meet regularly, though in all the time I knew her I
never once paid for her to translate for me. Her story was all too
familiar. She had had a respectable job as a prostitute, working in some of
the better clubs in the area, but desperation and an ugly knife scar across
her right cheek had led her into the sordid world of translation. Her
brother, Javier, sent by the family to Madrid to try to rescue her from
immorality, had fallen into the same trap. The first time I met him I knew
from the glazed eyes, ghoulish stare and nervous inability to stay quiet
that he was a simultaneous interpreter.

<P>After a change of government in Ireland and a new policy on international
"diplomacy" even my pitiful income for "information" had dried up, and I
eventually went to live with Amaia and Javier and inevitably to work with
them. Despite the apparent misery of our existence, they were not unhappy
times. I worked mainly as a "frilansa", having learnt from my new friends
to avoid the agencies, which tempted innocent young translators in with
promises of steady work and careful client control, but which always ended
up sapping the spirit of even the hardiest, forcing them to work
unbelievable hours at low pay, and never allowing them the chance to turn
down a trick, whatever the subject matter.

<P>Of course, we were continually hounded by the police, and could not afford
the back-handers paid by the agencies to keep the Civil Guard away. On many
occasions I was forced by unscrupulous policemen to do free work for them,
and on a few occasions even ended up doing court translations. Eventually
though, my luck ran out, and I spent six months in Carabanchel for
"comercio linguistico con el agravante de estilo libre". Naturally we were
deprived of all writing instruments in the cell; no paper, no pencils, just
an old Apple Mac, sarcastically referred to as a computer by the wardens. I
found it easier to use dried excrement to mark the walls with.

<P>After Amaia's tragic death, Javier went gradually downhill, working first
in a cheap agency and then translating computer manuals. When I last heard
from him he had become a lawyer.

<P>I drifted north to the Basque Country. On her death bed, Amaia had asked me
to visit her parents but not to tell them how she had spent her final
years, and when I eventually found them, a poor but proud family of sheep
farmers, I assured them that she had managed to get away from the world of
translation and had been working in a strip club near Cuatro Caminos.

<P>As for myself, once exposed to the "mundillo" of professional linguistics,
I could never escape. These days, Spanish law is more lenient towards us.
The revised Penal Code practically legalises translation, stating in the
preamble that "...while the practise is generally considered vile and
repulsive, [...] and condemned by many religious groups, it is our opinion
that it is a necessary evil, and that no attempt on the part of the
legislators will ever succeed in entirely ridding society of the practise.
We also consider that legalisation of translation may help to ensure that
it is carried out under better and more salutary conditions."
