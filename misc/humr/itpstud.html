<P>If this were your actual life, you would have received better instructions.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/o.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter O" HEIGHT="75">n the topic of the difference between knowing two languages and interpreting between them, my mother grew up speaking Polish and continued to use it to speak to her mother who never become very fluent in English and to have secret conversations with her sisters.  She wouldn't help me learn the language, which was disappointing.  After I became an interpreter, she would always ask me how my teaching was going.  I tried to describe the difference between teaching a deaf person and interpreting between a hearing teacher and a deaf student, but to no avail.  

<P>When my mother developed Alzheimer's, I took her to Las Vegas (which I loathe, but she loves) and we were playing the machines.  A woman came up to me and started to speak to me in what I thought was Russian, also gesturing that she was having trouble with her machine.  Since Russian and Polish are relatively similar (my mother used to tell me that she could understand Krushchev when she heard his voice in the background of the voice-overs), I asked my mom if she could help the lady out.  

<P>It turned out that the woman was actually speaking Polish.  We called over someone who helps with the machines and my mother acted as interpreter.  She did consecutive but you could see the mental strain of trying to figure out how to say it in the other language although she was fluent in both.  When all was resolved I turned to my mother and said, "You know that interpreting you just did between English and Polish?  That's the kind of thing I do with deaf people."  Unfortuantely she couldn't remember what just happened.  Oh well, two years too late!

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/d.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter D" HEIGHT="75">OLPHIN STRESS TEST
<P>It's a simple test designed to indicate whether people have too much stress in their life.  It's a picture of two dolphins. The two dolphins appear normal when viewed by a stress-free individual. This test is not accurate enough to pick up mild stress levels.  It's quite simple. If there is anything that appears different about the dolphins (ignore the fact of the slight color differences) it is often an indication of potential stress related problems. Differences, if any, may also indicate the source of your stress.

<P>Sit upright and viewing the screen head-on, take a deep breath, breathe out and then open the picture and look directly at it.  If there is anything out of the ordinary then you should consider taking things a little easier..

<P>We all know that hand gestures can spice up a story or punctuate
an idea.  But now it appears that waving hands and pointing fingers may
actually make our speech more articulate, too.

<P>Columbia University psychologist Robert Krauss, Ph. D., videotaped 41 students as they described action-packed excerpts from <I>Road Runner</I>
cartoons.  Half of the students were allowed to move their hands while
talking, while the rest were permitted to use only words.  The gestures,
it turned out, were more eloquent in recounting the coyote's foibles, at
least when explaining spatial relationship between objects or characters
-- for example, "The coyote is perched on a rock."  They also spoke more
quickly, were less likely to repeat themselves, and emitted fewer "ers"
and "ums."  The reason, suggests Krauss, is that gestures act as a mental
bridge between spatial concepts and words, making it easier for us to
think of the right phrase quickly.  While the study may shed light on
speech disorders, it's also a potent reminder that communicating is a
full body affair.
