<P>1. We admitted that we were powerless over the tendency to blurt "Count me 				
	in!  I'll do it!", and that our lives had become unmanageable.
<P>2. We have come to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could 	
	restore us to sanity.
<P>3. We made a decision to turn our skills and our lives over to the care of 
	the Interpreter Coordinator, as we understand him/her.
<P>4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of our skills.
<P>5. We admitted to our colleagues, to ourselves, and to the Interpreter 
	Coordinator the exact nature of our wrongs.
<P>6. We were entirely ready to attend workshops to remove all defects in our 	
	interpreting ability.
<P>7. We humbly ask the Deaf to have patience with our shortcomings.
<P>8. We made a list of all the Interpreters we had harmed, and we became 
	willing to make amends with them all.  [Editor would substitue "Deaf 	
	people".]
<P>9. We made direct amends to such interpreters whenever possible, except 
	when doing so would injure them or others.
<P>10. We continued to attend workshops and when we made an Interpreting 
	Error, promptly admitted it.
<P>11. We have sought through workshops, feedback, and mentoring to improve 	
	our contact with the Deaf (as we understand them), asking only for 
	knowledge of the Code of Ethics and the stamina to prevent Overuse 		
	Syndrome.
<P>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we have 
	tried to carry this message to other Interpreters, and to practice 
	these principles in our profession.

<P>"<IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/h.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter H" HEIGHT="75">ello, and welcome to the Psychiatric Hot Line.  If you are obsessive-compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.  If you are co-dependent, please press 2 for someone else.
If you have multiple personalities, please press 3, 4, 5, & 6.  If you are paranoid-delusional, we know who you are and what you want. . . just stay on the line so we can trace the call.  If you are schizophrenic, listen carefully and a little voice will tell you what number to press.  If you are depressed, it doesn't matter which number you press. . . no one will call you back."
