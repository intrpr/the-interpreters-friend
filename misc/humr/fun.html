<P>Legend has it that Eskimos (Inuit) have hundreds of words to describe snow. We Jews have hundreds of words for "pains in the neck." Among the many majesties of Yiddish, is its magical ability to turn words into an emotional thesaurus. Both the "good" and the "bad" alike are not merely "said." No.. They're felt - in all their subtle nuance and multiple meanings. This is never more true then when we're talking about a "fool" or a "nudnek," a "shliemel," or a "schnook." Face it. We Jews don't bear fools lightly. Who had time? So is it surprising that we have more words in Yiddish for fools than there are Golden Arches? These words are so delicious, many have become part of American jargon. Do you have the story about these words, and what they truly mean? In case you don't, as a public service, friends from Jewlarious are proud to present the first:  Yiddish-Yinglish Dictionary of Fools.

<P>There may be those among you who support including Spanish in our national language. I for one am 110% against this! We must preserve the exclusivity and, above all, the purity of the English language.To all the shlemiels, shlemazels, nebbishes, nudniks, klutzes, putzes, shlubs, shmoes, shmucks, nogoodniks, and momzers that are out there pushing Spanish, I just want to say that I, for one, believe that English and only English deserves linguistic prominence in our American culture. To tell the truth, it makes me so farklempt, I'm fit to plotz. This whole Spanish schmeer gets me broyges, specially when I hear these erstwhile mavens and luftmenschen kvetching about needing to learn Spanish. What
chutzpah! These shmegeges can tout their shlock about the cultural and linguistic diversity of our country, but I, for one, am not buying their shtick. It's all so much dreck, as far as I'm concerned. I exhort you all to be menshen about this and stand up to their fardrayte arguments and meshugganah, farshtunkene assertions. It wouldn't be kosher to do anything else. Remember, when all is said and done, we have English and they've got bubkes! The whole myseh is a pain in my tuchas!

<A HREF="http://www.aiic.net/ViewPage.cfm/page1254.htm">Rebellious words.</A> Tongue twisters, I suspect, are found in all languages. As a linguist I can't imagine that the phenomenon wouldn't occur in languages I don't know. (Dear reader, please correct me if you have proof to the contrary!) The way certain pairings of words get jammed on the tongue in one's effort to push them out of the mouth is independent of whether the accursed combination of syllables is on the long or short side, fortuitous but completely within the bounds of accepted grammar, or strung together intentionally for the desired effect, such as those sentences we are asked to say quickly three times in succession: "Ripe white wheat reapers reap ripe white wheat right."

Lasterday (refers to any day before today) we squinched (action required to fit something into a space that is slightly too small) a schmiglet (a small unit of measurement) of your awesomtastic (so wonderful the words just meld in your mouth) one-of-a-kind entries into this space in preparation for our Top Ten reveal.

We craughed (to cry and laugh simultaneously), we troddled (to wander around without knowing of doing so), and finally decided to use the schwack (a large amount) of multiple entries received as the basis for the Top Ten - this is, let's not forget, all about favoritism.

<P>From the thousands of submissions we received, here, then, are the ten words (not in the dictionary) entered the most often:

<P>"Doc, it's terrible," Jake said. "I've developed a horrible fear and have anxiety attacks every time I get in the car with these other four guys and commute to work. It's turned into a special fear of tunnels.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/i.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter I" HEIGHT="75"> am in the process of learning DGS (German Sign Language), so I asked one of my clients who is native in DGS how to sign <I>Wie geht's?</I> ("How are you?" but literally "How goes it?")  He started to smirk. He said that one of his pet peeves is that older Deaf Germans tend to sign "How walk?" because <I>gehen</I> also means "to walk".  That was interesting, but I roared when he also told me how some Deaf Germans sign <I>misverstehen</I> (misunderstand).  They sign MIST (crap) and VERSTEHEN (understand), which on the mouth looks like <I>misverstehen</I>, but literally means "[doesn't] understand crap". This by the way, is not the proper sign, which is the same as in ASL.
<P>For those interested in the actual signs: (1) Both hands are Y's, palms facing the signer and little fingers crossed, separate = WIE, then the non-dominant hand is held as in the ASL sign TABLE and the dominant hand walks the index and middle fingers down the arm from wrist to elbow = GEHEN.  (2) A "T" is held to the nose and descends in a zig-zag = MIST, then a "P" is held at the dominant side temple and moves left and right like the ASL sign CARELESS.

The police officer was rather "excited", particularly since he was also eyeing the family that was sitting in the car.  I spoke to this friend and asked him exactly what he said, and he repeated "puta del mundo".  At this time I advised this family friend that he was asking to see a prostitute.  The man was truly mortified.  I then told him that maybe he wanted to go to Punta del Mundo and explained to him that it was down the road a piece.

<P>Having chosen English as the preferred language in the EEC, the European Parliament has commissioned a feasibility study in ways of improving efficiency in communications between governmental departments.  European officials have often pointed out that English spelling is unnecessarily difficult - for example, cough, plough, rough, through and thorough.  What is clearly needed is a phased program of changes to iron out these anomalies.  The program would, of course, be administered by a committee staff at top level by participating nations.
<P>In the first year, for example, the committee would suggest using 's' instead of the soft 'c'.  Sertainly, sivil servants in all sities would resieve this news with joy.  Then the hard 'c' could be replaced by 'k' sinse both letters are pronounsed alike.  Not only would this klear up konfusion in the minds of klerikal workers, but typewriters kould be made with one less letter.
<P>There would be growing enthusiasm when in the sekond year, it was announsed that the troublesome 'ph' would henseforth be written'f'.  This would make words like'fotograf' twenty per sent shorter in print.
<P>In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expeketed to reash the stage where more komplikated shanges are possible.  Governments would enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.  We would al agre that the horible mes of silent e's in the languag is disgrasful.  Therfor we kould drop thes and kontinu to read and writ as though nothing had hapend.
<P>By this tim it would be four years sins the skem began and peopl would be reseptiv to steps sush as replasing 'th' by 'z'.

<P>The quantity of consonants in the English language is constant.  If omitted in one place, they turn up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks" his "cah", the lost R's migrate southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl wells".

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/c.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter C" HEIGHT="75"><BLINTON DEPLOYS VOWELS TO BOSNIA - Cities of Sjlbvdnz, Grzny to be first recipients</B>
<P>Before an emergency joint session of Congress yesterday, President Clinton announced US plans to deploy over 75,000 vowels to the war-torn region of Bosnia.  The deployment, the largest of its kind in American history, will provide the region with the critically needed letters A, E, I, O, and U, and is hoped to render countless Bosnian names more pronounceable.
<P>"For six year, we have stood by while names like Ygrvslhv and Tzlynhr and Glrm have been horribly butchered by millions around the world," Clinton said.  "Today, the United States must finally stand up and say 'Enough.'  It is time the people in Bosnia finally had some vowels in their incomprehensible words.  The US is proud to lead the crusade in this noble endeavor."
<P>The deployment, dubbed "Operation Vowel Storm" by the State Department, is set for early next week, with the Adriatic port cities of Sjlbvdnz and  Grzny slated to be the first recipients.  Two C-130 transport planes, each carrying 500 24-count boxes of E's will fly from Andrews Air Force Base across the Atlantic and airdrop the letters over the cities.
<P>Citizens of Grzny  and Sjlbvdnz eagerly await the arrival of the vowels. "My God, I do not think we can last another day," Trszg Grzdnjkln, 44, said.  "I have six children and none of them has a name that is understandable to me or anyone else.  Mr. Clinton, please send my poor, wretched family just one E. Please."
<P>Said Sjlbvdnz resident Grg Hmphrs, 67: "With just a few key letters, I could be George Humphries.  This is my dream."
<P>The airdrop represents the largest deployment of any letter to a foreign government since 1984.  During the summer of that year, the US shipped 92,000 consonants to Ethiopia, providing cities like Ouaouoaua, Eaoiiuae, and Aao with vital life-giving supplies of L's, S's and T's.  The consonant-relief effort failed, however, when vast quantities of the letters were intercepted by violent gun-toting warlords.

<P>NEWS BULLETIN:

<P>Saying it will improve the education of children who have grown up immersed in computer lingo, the school board in San Jose, Calif., has  officially
designated computer English, or "Geekonics", as a second language.  The
historic vote on Geekonics -- a combination of the word "geek" and the word
"phonics" -- came just weeks after the Oakland school board recognized black
English, or Ebonics, as a distinct language.  "This entirely reconfigures our
parameters," Milton "Floppy" Macintosh, chairman of Geekonics Unlimited, said
after the school board became the first in the nation to recognize Geekonics.
"No longer are we preformatted for failure," Macintosh said during a
celebration that saw many Geekonics backers come dangerously close to smiling.
"Today, we are rebooting, implementing a program to process the data we need to
interface with all units of humanity."  Controversial and widely misunderstood,
the Geekonics movement was spawned in California's Silicon Valley, where many
children have grown up in households headed by computer technicians,
programmers, engineers and scientists who have lost ability to speak plain
English and have inadvertently passed on their high-tech vernacular to their
children.

<P>HELPING THE TRANSITION

<P>While schools will not teach the language, increased teacher awareness of
Geekonics, proponents say, will help children make the transition to standard
English. Those students, in turn, could possibly help their parents learn to
speak in a manner that would lead listeners to believe that they have actual
blood coursing through their veins.  "Bit by bit, byte by byte, with the proper
system development, with nonpreemptive multitasking, I see no reason why we
can't download the data we need to modulate our oral output," Macintosh said.
The designation of Ebonics and Geekonics as languages reflects a growing
awareness of our nation's lingual diversity, experts say.  Other groups pushing
for their own languages and/or vernaculars to be declared official viewed the
Geekonics vote as a step in the right direction.  "This is just, like, OK, you
know, the most totally kewl thing, like, ever," said Jennifer Notat-Albright,
chairwoman of the Committee for the Advancement of Valleyonics, headquartered
in Southern California. "I mean, like, you know?" she added.

<P>THEY'RE HAPPY IN DIXIE

<P>"Yeee-hah," said Buford "Kudzu" Davis, president of the Dixionics Coalition.
"Y'all gotta know I'm as happy as a tick on a sleeping bloodhound about this.
We could be fartin' thru silk perty soon."  Spokesmen for several subchapters
of Dixionics -- including Alabonics, Tennesonics and Louisionics -- also said
they approved of the decision.  Bill Flack, public information officer for the
Blue Ribbon Task Force on Bureaucratonics said that his organization would not
comment on the San Jose vote until it convened a summit meeting, studied the
impact, assessed the feasibility, finalized a report and drafted a
comprehensive action plan, which, once it clears the appropriate subcommittees
and is voted on, will be made public to those who submit the proper
information-request forms.  Proponents of Ebonics heartily endorsed the
designation of Geekonics as an official language.  "I ain't got no problem wif
it," said Earl E. Byrd, president of the Ebonics Institute. "You ever try
talkin' wif wunna dem computer dudes? Don't matter if it be a white computer
dude or a black computer dude; it's like you be talkin' to a robot -- RAM, DOS,
undelete, MegaHertZ. Ain't nobody understands. But dey keep talkin 'anyway.
'Sup wif dat?" Those involved in the lingual diversity movement believe that
only by enacting many different English languages, in addition to all the
foreign ones practiced here, can we all end up happily speaking the same boring
one, becoming a nation that is both unified in its diversity, and diversified
in its unity.

<P>Others say that makes no sense at all. In any language.

<P><IMG SRC="../../rlgn/vocab/h.gif" ALT="Illuminated letter H" HEIGHT="75"><B>ow to win arguments, as it were</B>

<P>I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an
 argument on any topic, against any opponent.  People know this, and
 steer clear of me at parties.  Often, as a sign of their great
 respect, they don't even invite me.  You too can win arguments.
 Simply follow these rules:

<P>* Drink Liquor.

<P>Suppose you're at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding
 on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about.  If you're
 drinking some health-fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll hang
 back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot enthralls
 your date.  But if you drink several large martinis, you'll discover
 you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy.  You'll be a WEALTH of
information.  You'll argue forcefully, offering searing insights
 and possibly upsetting furniture.  People will be impressed.  Some may
 leave the room.

<P>* Make things up.

<P>Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove
 Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact that
YOU are underpaid, and you're damned if you're going to let a bunch of
 Peruvians be better off.  DON'T say: "I think Peruvians are
 underpaid."  Say: "The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars
 adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is
 $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level."

<P> NOTE: Always make up exact figures.

<P>If an opponent asks you where you got your information, make THAT up,
 too.  Say: "This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's study for
 the Buford Commission published May 9, 1982.  Didn't you read it?"
 Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say "You left your
 soiled underwear in my bath house."

<P> * Use meaningless but weighty-sounding words and phrases.

<P>Memorize this list:

<P>  Let me put it this way
<BR>  In terms of
<BR>  Vis-a-vis
<BR>  Per se
<BR>  As it were
<BR>  Qua
<BR> So to speak

<P>You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as "Q.E.D.,"
 "e.g.," and "i.e."  These are all short for "I speak Latin, and you do
 not."

<P>Here's how to use these words and phrases.  Suppose you want to say:
 "Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't
 have enough money."

<P>You never win arguments talking like that.  But you WILL win if you
 say: "Let me put it this way.  In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis
 Peruvians qua Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so
 to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were.
 Q.E.D."

<P>Only a fool would challenge that statement.

<P> * Use snappy and irrelevant comebacks.

<PYou need an arsenal of all-purpose irrelevant phrases to fire back at
 your opponents when they make valid points.  The best are:

<P> You're begging the question.
<BR> You're being defensive.
<BR> Don't compare apples and oranges.
<BR> What are your parameters?

<P>This last one is especially valuable.  Nobody, other than
 mathematicians, has the vaguest idea what "parameters" means.

<P>Here's how to use your comebacks:

<P> You say   As Abraham Lincoln said in 1873. . .
<BR> Your opponents says Lincoln died in 1865.
<BR> You say   You're begging the question.

<P>       OR

<P> You say   Liberians, like most Asians. . .
<BR> Your opponents says Liberia is in Africa.
<BR> You say   You're being defensive.

<P> * Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler.

<P>This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously
 right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say:
 "That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say" or
 "You certainly do remind me of Adolf Hitler."

<P>So that's it: you now know how to out-argue anybody.  Do not try to
 pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.

<P>English has classifiers too, although we don't use them too often.  I recently walked into the interpreting office at the King County Courthouse (Seattle, Washington) and saw a wonderful poster that had a block print of a rhinoceros and the following string of classifiers:

<P>A crash of rhinos.  A school of fish.  A litter of pups.  A flock of sheep.  A string of ponies.  A covey of partridges.  A pride of lions.  A herd of elephants.  A plague of locusts.  A colony of ants.  A covey of quail.  A kindle of kittens.  A leap of leopards.  A pod of seals.  A sloth of bears.  A rafter of turkeys.  A pace of asses.  A walk of snipe.  A gam (or pod) of whales.  A nest of rabbits.  A gang of elk.  A fall of woodchucks.  A dule of doves.  A skulk of foxes.  A dissimulation of birds.  A spring of teal.  A peep of chickens.  A bevy of roebucks.  A business of ferrets.   A bale of turtles.  A pitying of turtledoves.  A drift of hogs.  A paddling of ducks.  A siege of herons.  A trip of goats.  A charm of finches.  A cete of badgers.  A deceit of lapwings.  A shoal of bass.  An exaltation of larks.  A drove of cattle.  A singular of boars.  A tiding of magpies.  A gaggle of geese.  A congregation of plovers.  A husk of hares.  An unkindness (or murder) of ravens.  A labor of moles.  A richness of martens.  A cast of hawks.  A knot of toads.  A descent of woodpeckers.  A sounder of swines.  A mustering of storks.  A clutch of eggs.  A bouquet of pheasants.  An army of caterpillars.  A hover of trout.  A flight of swallows.  A troop (or mob) of kangaroos.  A clowder of cats.  A watch of nightingales.  A barren of mules.   A shrewdness of apes.  A rag of colts.  A murmuration of starlings.  A building of rooks.   A smack of jellyfish.  A harras of horses.  A parliament of owls.  A route of wolves.  A host of sparrows.  An ostentation of peacocks.  A blessing    of unicorns. A flink of cows.  An army of frogs. A mess of officers.

<P>I wish to add to the list my own invented classifier: a snuggle of interpreters.  I invented this because of the way some interpreters will put an arm around the other interpreter they are working with during interpretation from ASL to English.

<P>Cynthia Johnston adds: I refer to a group of interpreters as an ingot of interpreters. A good deal of our work is in facilitating the training of Deaf individuals to become employable. Therefore, our work allows for the creation of taxpayers in higher tax brackets. We are all worth our weight in gold.

<P>When you write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you write,
if the copy is right.  If however, your copy falls over, you must right
your copy.  If you write religious services you write rite, and have the
right to copyright the rite you write.

<P>Very conservative people write right copy, and have the right to
copyright the right copy they write.  A right wing cleric would write
right rite, and has the right to copyright the right rite he has the
right to write.  His editor has the job of making the right rite copy
right before the copyright can be right.

<P>Should Jim Wright decide to write right rite, then Wright would write
right rite, which Wright has the right to copyright.
Duplicating that rite would copy Wright right rite, and violate
copyright, which Wright would have the right to right.

<P>Right?

<P>1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.
<P>2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
<P>3. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.

<P>8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually)
   unnecessary.
<P>9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
<P>10. No sentence fragments.
<P>11. Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used.
<P>12. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
<P>13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's
    highly superfluous.
<P>14. One should NEVER generalize.
<P>15. Comparisons are as bad as clich&eacute;s.
<P>16. Don't use no double negatives.
<P>17. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.
