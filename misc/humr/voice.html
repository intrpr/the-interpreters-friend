Here are some examples:

Lest it may mar your fortunes. [William Shakespeare, <I>King Lear</I>]

The situation: employee goes to boss with suggestions & feedback for production efficiency.  They know each other well, like & respect each other.  You know?? I felt like things were just cookin'. . .  Right up to the point where I voiced for the Deaf man to a hearing employer  "Yeah, that'd be lovely".   LOVELY??!! Oi vay!  I know better. . . but obviously I'm not paying attention to that monitor very well.
