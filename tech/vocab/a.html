<P><DT>acceleration<DD><B>A-C-C-E-L.</B>  Note:  Can't use <B>FAST CHANGE</B> because the speed could be constant, but if the direction changes it would still be an acceleration, and you can't use <B>FAST INCREASE</B>, because if the speed decreases it is still technically an acceleration (albeit negative).

<P><DT>accurate<DD>(1) <B>(2h)[bX], DHPO away, NDPO towards, the union of the index finger and thumb circles that of the other hand and then lands direct on it.</B> For a QuickTime movie of this sign, see <A HREF="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/A/W0032.htm">ASL browser - accurate</A>.  (2) Sometimes the word "accurate" is differentiated from the word "exact".  Imagine a target where a gun aimed at the bull's-eye consistently hit the bottom of the target: the results would be "exact" in their consistency, but not "accurate".  Although the sign we have used for "accurate" is often used for "exact" too, we could use the following sign for "accurate" to make a distinction: <B>(2h)[1], DHPO down, NDPO towards, the FT of the index finger circles that of the other hand and then lands directly on it.</B>
