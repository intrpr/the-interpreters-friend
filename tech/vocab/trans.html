<P>I had the privilege of seeing Dragonsani Renteria and Jennifer Mantle, his partner, present a workshop in ASL at the 2005 RID convention in San Antonio, Texas about interpreting for Trans settings. The information was excellent and so infrequently disseminated. The workshop was very rich and went into the psycho-social aspects of the transition that Drago experienced and the profound adjustment that his partner made. These are important concepts, but I don't feel qualified to go into depth about them other than to describe the signs that they suggested and definitions for the terms from various sources. I would instead encourage interpreters to seek out a workshop of this nature by contacting <A hREF="http://drago.deafqueer.org/">these presenters</A> or other qualified parties because it is such a fascinating perspective on gender issues and requires a lot of preparation on the part of interpreters. I have also included websites on the subject.

<P><IMG SRC="../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="Stained glass bullet"><A HREF="http://www.genderpsychology.org/">Psychology of gener identity and transgenderism.</A> Academic perspectives on the psychology of transsexuality are represented by groups like the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) and are codified in the mental illness model of the DSM-IV-TR as Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and Transvestic Fetishism (TF). This psychopathology treats transsexuality and cross-dressing as inherently bad things about us. They're not. Gender bending, gender queers, and transgenderism show society how uncomfortable it is trying to understanding gender and sexuality. Can sexologists refrain from placing value judgements upon those with gender dysphoria and instead refine the way we understand the psychology of gender, atypical gender development, and gender role socialization? I hope that by bringing a personal and non-judgemental scientific approach to understanding transgenderism, I can help transsexuals, cross-dressers, and psychopathologists grow and develop as people.

<P><IMG SRC="../../sgb.gif" HSPACE="10" ALT="Stained glass bullet">Wikipedia. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual">Transexualism</A> is a condition in which a transsexual person self-identifies as a member of the gender opposite to the one assigned to them at birth. Transsexualism is considered a taboo subject in many parts of the world. The justifications for negative beliefs about transsexualism may be perceived as being supported by religious beliefs or cultural norms. It has become more widely known in Western nations in the late 20th century due to the sexual revolution, but remains a highly controversial topic.
