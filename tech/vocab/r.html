If the interpreter is representing a visual such as a drawing on the blackboard or an overhead, the interpreter should "reverse" their drawing so that if for example an inclined plane slopes form the audience's left to their right, the interpreter makes it slope from their left to their right also (which would be from the interpreter's right to his/her left).
