<P>The point of this page it to show which signs can be found in my 2-CD collection called <A HREF="http://www.theinterpretersfriend.com/my-cd.html#dict">Technical & specialized vocabulary ASL dictionary.</A> I don't expect anyone to read this page, but to arrive at it while searching for a specific sign. This way, they know they can find this sign in my CD dictionary. There is not a one-to-one correspondence between an English word and an ASL sign, so context is important. My dictionary does list these words according to discipline. When using the Find feature, remember to not leave a space at the end of the term, because each term here ends with a semicolon (;). Note that the semicolon shows the complete term, for example, "absolute (maximum, minimum);".
