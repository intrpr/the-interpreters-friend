<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>This tutorial utilizes Huetinck, L. (1994).  <I>Physics.</I>  Lincoln, NE: Cliffs Notes Inc.  The Page numbers and Figure numbers refer to that text.  I believe that the purchase of this book would be extremely helpful to interpreters to get a surface understanding of physics.  Enough so that the interpreter will understand the relationship between concepts.  This tutorial is meant to be used in conjunction with reading this book.  Not all of the book is covered, but a good portion of it is.  This has been used by me previously to teach a 30-hour course in interpreting for math and science and I hope it will prove useful to you the reader.  Generally the terms presented are in the text on the Pages mentioned.  Ocasionally I add some related concepts.  Click here for an <A HREF="glws.html">explanation of the glossing system.</A>

<P><DT>kinematics<DD><B>K-I-N-E-M-A-T-I-C-S.</B>

<DT>function of time<DD><B>F-BUSINESS DEPEND TIME.</B>
displacement<DD>(1) If it simply means movement, as in "the particle experiences a displacement", use <B>MOVE.</B>  (2) If it means the distance between the final position and the initial position, as it does in this context, use <B>HOW FAR FROM (&lt;) VERY-FIRST POSITION TO, (>) LAST POSITION.</B>  Note: <B>VERY-FIRST </B> means <B>DH signs FIRST but strikes the thumb of NDH [A], PO > DS, FO away.</B>  Don't sign something like <B>HOW-MUCH MOVE</B>, because a great deal of movement can equal no displacement if the object comes back to the same place it started.

<DT>velocity<DD>(1) <B>V-E-L.</B> Don't sign <B>FAST</B> because velocity is a vector and  speed is a scalar, as we will learn further in the book.

<DT>acceleration<DD><B>A-C-C-E-L.</B>  Note:  Can't use <B>FAST CHANGE</B> because the speed could be constant, but if the direction changes it would still be an acceleration, and you can't use <B>FAST INCREASE</B>, because if the speed decreases it is still technically an acceleration (albeit negative).

<DT>vector<DD><B>"V" shaken below NDH [1], PO down, FO > DS.</B>

<DT>direction<DD><B>SHOW MOVE WHERE.</B>  For example, "A vector has both magnitude and  direction."  Translation: <B>VECTOR SHOW HOW-MUCH? PLUS, MOVE WHERE?</B>

<DT>magnitude<DD>(1) <B>SHOW HOW-MUCH?</B>  (2) <B>NDH [B], PO up, FO away.  
DH [B], PO down, arcs in mound over NDH.</B>

<DT>force<DD><B>FORCE HOW-MUCH?</B>  The difficulty with simply signing <B>FORCE</B> is 
that this sign is a verb but the physics concept it a noun.

<DT>scalar<DD><B>S-C-A-L-A-R.</B>

<DT>proportional<DD><B>(2h)[P], POs down, FOs away, move downward at NDS 	then at DS.</B>

<DT>specify<DD><B>NDH [bO], PO up, FO away.  DH [bO], touches lips, then 		thumb and index of NDH.  This is the compound SAY~EXACT.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 4</B>

<P><DT>time elapsed<DD><B>TIME RUN-OUT.</B>

<DT>unit of length<DD><B>U-N-I-T SHOW LENGTH.</B>  I usually avoid spelling O-F since it muddies the concept.

<DT>meter<DD><B>"M".</B>  Standard abbreviation.

<DT>kilometer<DD><B>K-M.</B>  Standard abbreviation.

<DT>initial (position, velocity, or acceleration)<DD><B>VERY-FIRST, that is, DH 	[1] strikes thumb of A dot (handshape for TEN), PO > DS, FO away.</B>

<DT>meters/second/second<DD>To introduce the concept as is being done here, sign <B>"M" PER SECOND PER SECOND</B>, later, use the entry below.

<DT>m/s<SUP>2</SUP><DD>As with any fraction, show the numerator (whatever is above the fraction line) on a higher level than the denominator (what's below).  "Squared" is signed like <B>SECOND(-IN-ORDER)</B> but with a slight rise in level to show that the squared symbol is superscripted.

<DT>graph<DD>For the noun, as in "let's look at the graph", sign <B>FTs of DH [4] are drawn down NDH [B], PO towards, FO > DS, and then across it as if making a grid on a piece of paper.</B>  Note: for the verb, as in "now we will graph the function", don't sign <B>GRAPH</B>, but rather <B>DRAW GRAPH.</B> For example,  "Now we will graph the function."  Translation:  <B>NOW #DO-DO?  DRAW GRAPH.</B>  Not <B>NOW #DO-DO?  GRAPH "F".</B> 

<DT>constant<DD>For the adjective form, as in "the velocity is constant", you could sign <B>V-E-L CONTINUE</B>, but that's not quite the right concept.   "Constant" in this context means "doesn't change" not "doesn't stop", so better <B>V-E-L + [B^] (fingers form right angle with palm), PO away, FO up, moves away from signer.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 5</B>

<P><DT>velocity versus time<DD>(1,  at least initially to show the concept visually) <B>Show the rectangular coordinate system by using an L-CL as the x,y-axis and sign 1-CL'moves along thumb which represents x-axis', TIME. 1-CL'moves along forefinger which represents y-axis', V-E-L.</B> (2) <B>(&lt;) V-E-L, COMPARE (>) TIME.</B>  

<DT>increasing<DD><B>INCREASE++"pc", that is sign INCREASE several times while 
moving hands upwards and with puffed cheeks to show durational progress, as you do with signs like EVERY-WEEK.</B>

<DT>decreasing<DD><B>DECREASE++"pc", that is sign DECREASE several times while 
moving hands downwards and with puffed cheeks to show durational
progress, as you do with signs like EVERY-WEEK.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 6</B>

<P><DT>instantaneous<DD><B>This sign looks like the sign SECOND(the unit of time), but the hands move backwards only, not forward and then back.  Because the two words "instantaneous" and "speed" are frequently used together in physics, the sign FAST (which is often used for instant or immediate) should not be used in this context.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 7</B>

<P><DT>slope of a tangent<DD><B> For "tangent (line)", describe what is being touched, and then sign  LINE TOUCH, (2h)[B^]-CL'swivel to show how the slope varies' HOW-MUCH? </B>

<DT><IMG SRC="lim.gif" ALT="the equation mentioned below"><DD>This is read, "V equals the limit of delta v over delta t as time goes to zero."  Translation: <B> "V" EQUAL LIMIT FOR TRIANGLE "V" B-CL'shows fraction bar' TRIANGLE "T" WHILE TIME ARRIVE"step by step" ZERO.</B>  "step by step" is a modulation where instead of the DH "arriving" at the NDH in one movement, it starts and stops to emphasize the "approach". 

<DT>infinitesimally short<DD><B>SHORT AWFUL"hu" IDEA~LIKE B-CL'shows fraction 
bar' I-CL'draws a figure eight.</B> 
<DT>decrease while it travels upward<DD>This is somewhat awkward to describe but bear with me.  <B>The 5-CL can be used to show movement and pace.  It is held under the object that is moving with its PO away from the object and parallel to the direction in which the object is moving.  It shakes from side to side more slowly as the object moves higher in its trajectory and slows down.  Use an A-CL for objects unless they are wheeled vehicles (3-CL), rockets (R-CL) or planes (ILY-CL).  Show the object slowly rising and slowing down.</B>  

<DT>increase downward<DD><B>Signed opposite to the entry above, where the object falls and gains speed.</B> 

<P><B><DT>Page 8</B>

<P><DT>equation<DD><B>Many people sign E-LINE, but I prefer EQUAL(x1)~SENTENCE, 
that is, execute the sign EQUAL, but with a single movement and immediately sign SENTENCE from the final position.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 9</B>

<P><DT>three dimensional<DD><B>3 "D".</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 10</B>

<P><DT>italic<DD><B>Sign whatever is in italics and then use (2h)B-CL'POs >&lt;, FOs up, slant FOs to the right to show the slant of the italics'.</B> 

<DT>The tail of one vector, in this case (A), is moved to the head of the other vector (B).  The vector sum (C) is the vector that extends from the tail of one vector to the head of the other.<DD><B> Use the index fingers of each hand to represent the vectors, with the tip of the finger being the head of the arrow and the knuckle being the tail.   A, 1-CL'show the angle of vector A and hold it there.'  B (italics means use the NDH), 1-CL'place the index finger against the knuckle of the DH hand to show tip to tail'.  Keep the NDH as a placeholder and draw a line with the DH index finger from the knuckle of the NDH to where the DH FT was.  Now sign THAT*  TOTAL.  Note: TOTAL is (2h)[5], NDHPO up, DHPO down, FOs away.  Hands interchange POs, close to (2h)[O^], and end by touching FTs.</B>

<DT><IMG SRC="gk/lcthe.gif" ALT="lowercase theta"> (theta)<DD><B>DH [1], PO down, FO > NDS, is held in front of (or behind) NDH [O], PO > DS.</B>

<DT>horizontal axis<DD><B>Holding the NDH in an L-shape to represent the x,y-
axis, sign 1-CL'moves along thumb which represents x-axis'.</B>

<DT>resultant<DD><B>R-END VECTOR.</B>  Where you will recall that the second sign is <B>"V" shaken below NDH [1], PO down, FO > DS.</B> 

<DT>is the diagonal of a parallelogram with sides A and B<DD>(Refer to Figure 5.)  <B>Draw a parallelogram with both hands that starts at the far apex, both hands come to the close apex, and then with the NDH held in place, the DH moves from the close apex to the final, showing the diagonal.</B> 

<P><B><DT>Page 11</B>

<P><DT>An alternate method is to add the negative of a vector, which is a vector with the same length but pointing in the opposite direction<DD>(Refer to Figure 6.)  <B>Use the left hand for vector A and point the index finger in the 
appropriate direction.  Now place the end of the right hand index finger 
(representing B) against the FT of the left hand.  This represents A + B.  To show the addition of the negative of B, rotate B around 180º while still in contact with the FT of the left hand and now you have A – B.  As you can see in Figure 6, this is the vector D which begins at the tail of A and ends at the head of B.</B>  

<DT>components<DD><B>PART"each".</B>

<DT>rectangular coordinate system<DD><B>NDH [L], PO away, FO up.  DH shakes 		"X" at thumb and "Y" at index finger.</B>  Note: One can sign 
<B>R-E-C-T-A-N-G-U-L-A-R  C-O-O-R-D SYSTEM</B>, but  once the 
English is shown a few times, the meaning is conveyed by the above.

<DT>x-axis<DD>To introduce concept, FS fully.  Later,
<BR><B>

<BR><I>L-CL---------------------------------------------------------------></I>
<BR>starting well back to include the negative part of the axis.

<DT>cosine<DD><B>C-O-S.</B>

<P><DT>signs of the components<DD>Sometime "sign" means "symbol" as in "square root sign".  Here it means whether the components are positive or negative so sign <B>(<) POSITIVE, (>) NEGATIVE, WHICH?</B>

and similarly for the other quadrants.  Later you can drop the FS part.  Note: 3-D has eight octants, few instructors try to show this visually!

<DT><IMG SRC="hyp.gif" ALT="the equation mentioned below">	
<DD>When you have an extended expression like this under a square root sign, it is best to put the square root sign in after the entire quantity has been signed, just as you would do if writing this equation on a piece of paper.  So it would look this <B>"C" EQUAL C X'subscripted' SQUARED R-CL'place square root over quantity'.</B>

<P><B><DT>Page 13</B>

<P><DT>tangent<DD>Sometimes "tangent" means to touch, as discussed concerning "slope of the tangent" on Page 7, but here is means a trigonometric function, which is abbreviated <B>T-A-N.</B> 

<DT>tan<SUP>-1</SUP> C<SUB>y</SUB>/C<SUB>x</SUB><DD>
This is read "the inverse tangent of C sub y over C sub x" and can be signed <B>INVERSE T-A-N FOR C Y'subscripted' (move hand down to 
show this is in the denominator) C X'subscripted'</B>, where <B>INVERSE is (2h)[V], POs away, FOs >&lt;, move towards signer and supinate, that is turn POs towards.</B>  If you sign it as if it were a power, it is conceptually inaccurate, but the student may prefer it since that is its iconography (the way it is symbolized).

<DT>change in the direction of the velocity<DD><B>V-E-L CHANGE, 1-CL'show change of direction'.</B> 

<DT>a mass<DD>Sometimes "mass" refers to the characteristic that makes an object resistance to change of motion, as in Page 18.  Here it just means an object, so sign <B>SOMETHING HAVE M-A-S-S, A-CL'place object in space'.</B>  Use a different classifier if it's more appropriate.  

<DT>moves in a horizontal circle<DD><B>MOVE HOW? 1-CL'shows horizontal circular

Page 13.  

<DT>weight<DD>Don't sign <B>WEIGH</B> because "weight" is very different from "mass".  Some people sign <B>M-WEIGH</B>, but it's difficult to see the difference between <B>[M]</B> and the regular handshape for weigh.

<DT>right-hand rule (See Figure 69) – To find the direction of the force on the charge, with a flat hand, point your thumb in the direction of the velocity of the positive charge and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field.  The direction of the force is out of the palm of your hand.<DD><B> This is often used on blackboards, so this is a good place to talk about whether to reverse what's on the blackboard or not.  It certainly is not necessary to represent equations from  the signer's right to the signer's left (unless the interpreter is left-handed), as if Deaf people were not used to reading fingerspelling from the signer's perspective.  If the interpreter is representing a visual such as a drawing on the blackboard or an overhead, the interpreter should "reverse" their drawing so that if for example an inclined plane slopes form the audience's left to their right, the interpreter makes it slope from their left to their right also (which would be from the interpreter's right to his/her left).  In this situation, the interpreter might turn slightly to emphasize that it is coming out of the blackboard behind and the interpreter is not doing it from his/her perspective.</B>
