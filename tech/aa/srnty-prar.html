<P>GOD GIVE-TO-me (&lt;) PEACE ACCEPT THINGS ME CAN'T CHANGE, (>) BRAVE CHANGE THINGS ME CAN, AND WISDOM KNOW  (2h)alt.INDEX-'lf and rt' DIFFERENT.

<HR><P><B><U>Notes</U>:</B> Not very revolutionary. (&lt) means shift left, (>) means shift right, and (2h)alt.INDEX-lf and rt means point the left hand diagonally away towards the left and the right hand to the right and move them towards the body and away from the body in an alternating fashion as in the sign SHOW-OFF.

<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B>

<P>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.
