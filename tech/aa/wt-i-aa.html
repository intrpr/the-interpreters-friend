<P><B><U>Text</U>:</B>

<P>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their  experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

<P>The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.

<P>AA is  not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any  causes.

<P>Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.
