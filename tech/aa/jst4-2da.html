<P>Just for today, my thoughts will be on my recovery, living and enjoying life without the use of drugs.

<P>Just for today, I will have faith in someone in NA who believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery.

<P>Just for today, I will have a program. I will try to follow it to the best of my ability.

<P>Just for today, through NA, I will try to get a better perspective on my life.

<P>Just for today, I will be unafraid. My thoughts will be on my new associations, people who are not using and who have found a new way of life. So long as I follow that way, I have nothing to fear.
