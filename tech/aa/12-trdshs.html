<P><B>Text:</B> 

<P>1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon <BR>A.A. unity. 

<P>2. For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authority--a loving God <BR>as he may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but <BR>trusted servants; they do not govern. 

<P>3. The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking. 

<P>4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups <BR>of A.A. as a whole. 

<P>5. Each group has but one primary purpose--to carry its message to the <BR>alcoholic who still suffers. 

<P>6. An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any <BR>related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property <BR>and prestige divert us from our primary purpose. 

<P>7. Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside <BR>contributions. 

<P>8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our <BR>service centers may employ special workers. 

<P>9. A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards <BR>or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 

<P>10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. <BR>name ought never be drawn into public controversy. 

<P>11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than <BR>promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of <BR>press, radio and films. 

<P>12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever <BR>reminding us to place principles before personalities.

<P>[Note: Some groups have member say, along with the chair, "principles before personalities"].
