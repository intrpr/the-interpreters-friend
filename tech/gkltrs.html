<p> The names of the letters of the Greek alphabet could be fingerspelled, but this becomes awkward when dealing with equations.  Some people represent these letters by taking the handshape for the first Roman letter of the name and bringing it down the nose once or twice, similar to the sign <b>GREECE</b>.  This leads to some difficulties with Greek letters whose names start with the same Roman letter, for example, <i>pi, phi,</i>and <i>psi.</i>Another alternative is to trace the shape of the letters in the air, as if you were writing them on an invisible blackboard.  This option works for most of the letters, but is not as clear with some of the letters that require "lifting the chalk from the board" to write.  It seems more visual to represent these letters by a static handshape (one-handed or two-handed).  These special letters are listed below.  <a href="glws.html">Explanation of glossing system </a>
